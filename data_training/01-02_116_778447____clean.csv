In fact, I hate articles like this.<p>A real developer who loves his project would never outsource major aspects of the project.  One might outsource the design, only because its incredibly difficult to create a great UI and have the know-how to code it as well.<p>One might outsource the slicing of a layout to CSS/HTML or something simple like that while dealing with IMPORTANT issues such as database architecture, setting up the server, etc.<p>To suggest that you want to concentrate on the ""business aspect"" simply means that you don't want to do the hard part.  By outsourcing, the article states: ""I have more time and I can spend this time for marketing and blogging"". ... Right. Because blogging and marketing is so very tough?<p>The truth is that you USED to be a developer. It sounds like you've realized this and outsourced the project to an actual developer.  If that's the case then you've made a wise choice.<p>In any case, best of luck to you.<p>Edit: It sounds as though I am belittling other people's jobs on a project.  Sorry, I guess to some degree I am?  I agree that I am a bit foolish to say that. I don't mean to create any type of hostility in this thread.  (Regardless I will keep my full comment here so this thread makes sense.)<p>My main point is that the author refers to himself as a DEVELOPER.  Therefore it does not make sense to me to outsource his own specialty.",1339379727

4092888,comment,4088214.0,4092506.0,1,0,Mz,,,"You might try searching for the term ""variant cystic fibrosis"" as well. There is no hard and firm definition. It is a newish diagnosis which basically recognizes that some people suffer the same issues as classical CF but to a less severe degree, kind of like Asperger's and several other forms of ""autism spectrum disorder"" get recognized as a milder form of the problem known as classic Kanner's Syndrome (aka severe autism).<p>The most common test is a sweat chloride, which basically measures the saltiness of your sweat. Historically, a result below 40 was considered normal, above 80 was CF and the range in between was an undefined grey zone which is now recognized as a milder form of CF. My son and I both tested consistently at 41. Though I have heard some different number ranges discussed on some lists, so there may be some variables I am unaware of.<p>I am not sure how you can get one. Mine required referral but my ex was career military and the referral was necessary so insurance would pay a civilian facility for the services. It simply isn't done just anywhere. There are several techniques, all noninvasive.<p>Some nonscientific ""tests"" or indicators: Does your skin/sweat taste saltier than average? Do you get worse aquagenic wrinkling than most people (in other words, do you prune up badly in the bath)? Do you seem more prone than average to suffer shocks from static electricity? Those are all typical for CF.<p>Best of luck.",1339379492

For argument's sake, let's assume there's no such thing as God -- then the entire basis for every religion is fraudulent and perpetuates falsehoods resulting in the manipulation of a community of people to think, act, tithe, and multiply according to the rules of that church.  If all faiths happen to be incorrect, then aren't they guilty of the same sin ... perpetuating a fictional promise and manipulating a community (whether they know they're doing it or not) in an exploitive way?  Or is it less bad because there's potentially a perceived positive effect on the individuals and the community?<p>Look, I realize debating religion online is pretty futile, and I'm no fan of Scientology or any other religion for that matter.  I do get what your saying.  I also have no idea what your religious views are ... but I've had a ton of debates where people seem to be blinded by how they were brought up and can only see outward from the religious views they hold as the truth.

Maturity, and the turning of generations, does something to an organization. Christianity began as an apocalypse cult, after all, promising hope of the afterlife for the downtrodden; it wasn't until Constantine was converted that it started to learn how to be a state religion; and not until Martin Luther and Henry VII did it learn to be <i>just</i> a religion. (The exile into Babylon and the dissolution of the Caliphate had similar effects on Judaism and Islam.)<p>In other words, they were forced to let go of their control simply because of historical circumstance. Straight through World War 2, the Vatican continued to exert a very strong influence on European nations... because the Pope was everyone's ambassador, even if he could no longer threaten excommunication with meaningful clout.<p>Scientology has not had these experiences. It is young and not officially descended from any known religion, so ""sect"" would be an incorrect term except in cases where you consider the entire whole of Judaism or Christianity a sect. It is dominated by personality cults, from the original of L. Ron Hubbard to its scheme of hooking celebrities to be spokespersons.",1339377749

Yes, a lot of people were dissing tunnels yesterday. I'm actually a big fan of tunnels. I think the way the IPv4 Internet was built originally was basically by tunneling over the phone system. Ignore, you know, getting leased lines, putting computers on the end, building a network with no cooperation at all from the phone company. In fact, I once saw a phone company memo that referred to the Internet as a 'hostile overlay'. You know, and we basically, you know, demolished their billing plans and everything, and built this network in spite of the desires of the carriers. And, as I see the IPv4 Internet getting more and more like the phone company, I thought one way to deploy IPv6 is basically tunnel over all that junk. Iterate the same thing again. And I gather, you know, some people, you know, who are concerned about this are looking at other ways of sort evolving the Internet, where you, you know, tunnel over HTTP or whatever you have to do to basically get over all that cruft and build a new network on top of it. So that, to me, was one possible way, you know, as the IPv4 Internet rotted the underneath. We would tunnel over it and then we would throw away the rotted bits and replace them with wires.""",1339377065
