I've used it for the past 5 years and found out that its reliable, reasonably well updated, and very flexible.<p>However, you desperately need a fast network to take advantage of it even in a small sized cluster (N < 10). In a midsized cluster, latency will kill you from all angles unless you have very low throughput.<p>Lastly, do not rely on their NUMFA translator. If you need sharding then do it yourself. Also striping a large file system with many small files will make it slower rather than faster because of seek locality.<p>I've managed to hack out a system that works without maintenance now for 1 year plus, but if I had to do it again I'd go in with a lot of testing and an eye to write my own translator or at least highly customize one that they ship with.<p>Their code is clean.

2695204,comment,2695099.0,2695099.0,7,0,redthrowaway,,,"Curious.  Anonymous went after a slough of aussie government and telco sites a few years ago when the blacklist was announced, but that action was limited to DDoSes. At the time, there was only a minimal acknowledgement from Conroy et al of the downtime, and nothing from telcos.  This seems to be entirely different.  It seems that Telstra is conflating LulzSec with Anonymous, and presuming that the blacklist (something Anon hates) will attract the ire of LulzSec, whose attacks have been far more damaging than Anon's.<p>It's easy for somebody who follows the issues closely to deride this as misinformed paranoia, but I wonder what a lay person, even one who had heard of the two groups, would think about their respective motivations and capabilities.  It could well be that the people who advise on these decisions simply saw the name ""LulzSec"" and, knowing something about Internet culture, assumed they were connected to Anonymous and shared common desires.  What's scarier, that person could rightly be considered an expert on the matter in most lay groups.",1308988181

I would pick up trash in the mountains, because the mountains belong to everyone (or the government, which in theory is everyone).<p>With the sandwich shops, I think capitalism could deliver: if people would realize the value of having sandwich shops in the park, they would perhaps be willing to pay for sandwiches, making it profitable to build nice sandwich shops.<p>Sandwich shop owners as well as people living near the park would be motivated to keep it nice, as it would improve both the sandwich shop and the value of the houses around it.<p>Maybe there are aspects of what you are doing that I don't see, though. As long as the landlord lets you live there, maybe you get to live in a nice place for a low rent. If you ever have to move, your landlord might write you a glowing letter of recommendation and make it easy for you to find another nice place.

2695187,comment,2694536.0,2695113.0,9,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Hmm. I'm not sure how to respond, honestly.<p>I don't feel like I'm investing into a place I'm renting; I feel like I'm investing into my home, and by extension, myself. Every time I walk outside, I feel like I've accomplished something, even if it's a relatively small thing. No matter how anything else is going in my life, that feeling is still there.<p>If the owners decided to boot us out this month and sell the place for more than they could have otherwise, or even rent it out to someone else now that they can get more for the rent, I still would not feel like I had done something foolish. I still, for a while, will have made a place better. Even if new tenants or owners stopped maintaining it and let it go to ruin, that would only be a decision they have made, and still not change what I had done.<p>It's made the other people in the neighborhood happy. It's made me happy. It's made the landlords happy. Maybe I could have spent the time and money on something else, but that's true no matter what I do. So, why not do something that makes so many people happy?<p>> <i>Yes, society is cheering on the people who sacrifice themselves...</i><p>On my good days, I think that might be because society is looking for leaders that they can look up to. On my bad days, I think that might be because society has gotten lazy and just wants someone else to take care of it.<p>> <i>But I doubt that is for the best of the individual.</i><p>It might not be best for many individuals, because it's easy to feel like you're being taken advantage of, or that you're giving up something you shouldn't be.<p>But, for some individuals -- a growing number of them, I hope -- some forms of sacrifice can be so rewarding that it doesn't feel at all like sacrifice.<p>> <i>Of course people are cheering if they get something out of you for free.</i><p>Sure, but maybe you're getting to do something you enjoy anyway. If you go out for a hike or visit a river or beach, why not pick up some trash while you're out there? If you're going to live in a home, why not improve it a bit while you're there? If you're going to get together with some friends, why not bring some food? And if people cheer you on for that, is that so bad?<p>Anyway, the most powerful motivation, for me, is that I can see as clearly as if I were living in it now a world in which everyone else did things like this -- looked out for each-other, helped each-other up, cleaned up and improved the things around them, and invested in great little bistros and sandwich shops and bookstores and parks and such because they recognized the value of having such things in their community.<p>I've found that it's impossible to tell anyone else what that kind of world looks like, or to get them to believe in it by talking about it. So, instead, I try to make it.<p>One run-down house at a time. :-)",1308987533

A single 4-5 hour long run burns a pound of fat (and uses many times that much water) for a moderately fit man.  If effort isn't made to regain that fat, it's gone.  In general, I think an <i>hour</i> for .2lbs of fat is probably a good bet.

It's an experience so far out of the common framework of language and rational thinking that it's hard to exactly pinpoint what changes inside of you, but for me one of the biggest eye-openers was seeing myself from an outer perspective, seeing all the little selfish thinking that drives me most of the time. And appreciating the unique experience of life not filtered by my rational and rigid self for a few moments. This experience does not favour the traditonal society where a lot of people would love you being reduced to a part of the machine, for various selfish and misguided reasons.<p>It should be said that a trip can also be the worst experience of your life; you can live through the biggest fears you could not imagine that even existed.

To solve this you would want to change the salt whenever you change the password, which involves doing all the iterations again.

The more engineer interested people find jobs in the military. There they work on extremely costly projects like nuclear aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, nuclear weapons, drones, fighter planes, etc. These projects come with a huge price tag. The technologies used, the specifications used, the processes used are mostly incompatible with what a civil market needs. So the military engineers are naturally trained in the wrong direction. For example a vehicle constructed for the military is heavy, provides protection, has a huge payload, is robust, has infrastructure for certain types of equipment, etc.. Think of a tank or a hummer. Most of these requirements don't fit into what is needed for, say, automobiles. There we need to look at design, comfort, fuel efficiency, etc. But the US cars mostly (not all) are oversized, bulky, fuel inefficient, ugly. Why? Because the engineer culture constantly has an influx of different values coming from military engineering.\nFor them it is more important to drive securely through the streets of Bagdad, and not through some large US city.<p>Now, I think there is a need to work on topics like cyber security, but it may help at the same time to reduce other projects like the large spying agencies and much of the military. Currently these are expanding in the wrong direction.",1308985449

2695139,story,,,9,5,wollw,Ask HN: Taking your programming skills seriously?,,"Hello Hacker News,<p>About five years ago I dropped out of art school for psychological reasons and I've been living with my parents almost ever since.  Fortunately I have parents who have been kind and supporting of me during this time but as you can probably imagine I feel like a total leech.  In an attempt to do <i>something</i> with my life I started taking classes at the local community college about two years ago but was mostly taking them for my parents' sake rather than my own.<p>Even though my college 'career' has always been in fine arts I've personally been programming as a hobby on and off for over a decade.  Until recently this wasn't something I really thought I had any 'real' ability at, and left it at that.  This changed during a recent stay at nearby community where you pretty much just worked to earn your keep.  While there I ended up building a system to log and graph their off the grid power system to help monitor usage patterns.  Building that project forced me to get a much deeper understanding of Perl (the language I ended up using) than I previously had.  After that was finished I helped a few other people build a wireless network using XBees to monitor some other of their utilities from around the property.  Previously, I didn't think I was capable of programming something that would make people's lives easier; having done so was a real revelation.<p>A few months have passed since then and I'm currently living with my parents.  After seeing that I can build a usable and helpful program I'm rethinking things and am starting to take this hobby of mine more seriously than I did before.  What I'm wondering now is what sort of things I should do to grow more as a programmer.  I feel like I have a decent understanding of how to program but have never taken any formal classes.  I'm thinking about taking some CS classes at the local community college in the fall (seems they have at least a decent department if the fact they teach C++ and Assembly as their intro and advanced languages) but wonder if this would be worth my time at this point.<p>Any advice/comments would be appreciated.<p>edit: As for knowledge I have... I have a pretty good grasp on C and Perl, have spent a decent amount of time with ARM assembly and some AVR, and recently played with Scheme (I've been reading The Little Schemer).  I've played with a lot of different languages but these are the ones I feel most comfortable with.  I'm also reading through the Android documentation and learning a bit more about OOP in the process (as well as touching Java for the first time).",1308985219
