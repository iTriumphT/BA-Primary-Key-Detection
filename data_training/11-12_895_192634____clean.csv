I think you might be asking yourself the wrong question when you go to these events though.<p>Over the past two years, I've noticed that the ratio of prizes to teams at any given hackathon has been approaching 1:2.  All that means is that ""winning"" in the sense of getting a prize is becoming more and more common.  It leaves me wondering if the people who are winning these events now are getting the same amount of benefit as the people who were winning when I first started out.  Thus, I think the more important question that people should be asking is ""How do I get the best experience out of this event?"".<p>I think your writeup did a great job of nailing exactly how to do that:<p>1.

I've also been a graphic artist and built the official TV CGs effects for World Cup 1998. I pretend to know quite a bit about why people (including myself) create music or art, and I can affirm you that even the worst commercial, tasteless eurodance artist doesn't do it for the money <i>first</i>. They want to perform their art first, then seek a way to get money while doing it.<p>Selling your art can take numerous forms.

I totally agree that most people involved in startups are way too busy 'living the startup-life' and forgetting about the essence and true face of it all, namely that it still is ""hardcore business"". it still requires picking up the phone, ramping up customer after customer, smart investment of resources and selling 'to the person' and not just tweet about it, and so forth. but, as said, flip-side: if all startups were to face the most traditional form of doing business every day, most would simply not find it fun enough to dedicate their passion to this. so we get a little leeway so we can move around our actual duties and it's all good. there's just this super-fine-line that most of us overlook eventually, where people forget about the essence of what they're supposed to do and just enjoy the lifestyle a tad more than it might be healthy to the mission.<p>great article, definitely one i'll be coming back to for a refreshing read every once in a while in the future.",1353929808

Each browser and OS has it's own benchmark to be included as a root CA, and it's certainly not a 'pick and choose' thing. There are clearly defined rules for each, most of them relying on an independent audit to either WebTrust or an ETSI standard - neither of which are particularly 'easy' or 'cheap'. You're welcome to go and get an audit, set up your CA infrastructure and apply to MS and become a 'trusted' CA. Then you just have to repeat that for all the other big software/OS vendors, and then wait a few years till those versions in which you're included are in wide distribution (or not, as things like Windows have an auto-update mechanism and the auto-update of Firefox and the like are making the process much easier!).<p><i>Many of these companies claim this excess cost</i><p>There is an inherent cost in the verification of <i>some</i> certificates. Sometimes, it's just an automated domain-verification. Certificates are often sold on the level of verification performed - and in some cases the browsers treat these differently and display different UI chrome as a result.<p><i>(over the technical costs which are low)</i><p>Again, not really. It's certainly not a low cost to have an infrastructure to pass one of the aforementioned audits. Not only that, there are some significant costs in supporting the revocation infrastructure - especially if you happen to have a certificate on a high-traffic site (think Twitter, any of Apple/Microsoft/Amazon etc.) You'll have to support both a CRL infrastructure (TB a day of transfer) and an OCSP infrastructure (not as much transfer, but not 'just' static files). We're taking tens to hundreds of thousands of hits/second.<p><i>But in my experience, from buying certificates, certificate authorities never do this</i><p>Ignoring that the plural of 'anecdote' is not 'evidence', I'd say that there certainly are certificates where the ordering process is very simple and has nothing more than a domain-ownership confirmation. There's probably more verification in the payment end. However, getting an EV certificate does contain a significant verification process that sadly isn't the easiest. Code-signing certs tend to require a bit more in the way of ID verification also.<p><i>Honestly any SSL certificate which costs more than $5~10 is a rip-off</i><p>If you don't want to pay 'extortionate' costs for a certificate, try offers like this - or as someone else suggested below, StartCom - Eddy runs a great company and gives away a lot of certificates and charges minimal costs for the rest.\n'Course, we should always buy things based on what we <i>think</i> they should cost, not what they actually do...<p>Disclaimer: I work for a CA. Just wanting to add a viewpoint from the 'other side'. I won't disagree we're a reasonably un-liked industry in places (HN especially!). There are a few misconceptions, though.",1353927933
