861284,comment,860825.0,861167.0,0,0,danudey,,,"The real answer to this is to pay attention. The body has all kinds of warning signs and notifications, but most people don't pay attention to them.<p>For example, after you finish a meal, do you feel like you ate too much? You probably did, and yet most people have it so ingrained into them by their parents to finish everything on their plate that they overeat, which messes up your body's metabolism (it thinks there's a glut of resources and converts to 'store fat for later' mode).<p>A past roommate used to have a huge problem with his skin, lots of acne and rashes and so on, until one day he had the flu so bad he couldn't get out of bed for a few days. His friends were literally bringing food to him at his apartment because he couldn't get off his couch. By the end of the week, his skin had cleared up. Within two days after recovering, his skin had gone to hell again. Sick again, healthy skin.<p>After analyzing it, he determined that the only significant change (other than actually being sick) was his diet. He made a list of all the things he typically ate, and introduced them back one by one. Turns out eggs, which are 'good for you', were an allergen. He cut them out of his diet and he's been healthier, sick less often, clear skin, and a host of other minor improvements.<p>If you eat something then your stomach feels upset, stop eating it. Get a little note pad and jot down what you eat whenever you eat it, or just make a note in your head. If you start feeling unwell (stomach, headache, etc.) 20-40 minutes later, make a note of what it was, and cut it out of your diet.<p>One day, just out of high school, I was cleaning up my desk at home and realized that most of the pop cans I had on my desk were half-full. I wasn't finishing my Dr. Pepper, even though I really liked it. Then I thought about it and realized I didn't really like it. I used to, but I kept drinking it out of habit. Still, if I wasn't finishing it, I must not like it that much. I stopped buying it. I've since cut out all canned beverages and fountain drinks. After a year or so, I discovered that I can no longer tolerate them. I've removed them from my diet, and now my body doesn't have the resistance it's built up to them.<p>I could probably build up a tolerance to them again if I wanted, but why would I do that? You shouldn't be eating or drinking anything you have to build up a tolerance to.<p>For your specific case, make some notes of how you feel, and then change things. Take a baseline, then add more protein. Take some Omega-3 supplements, remove carbs for a week or two, and see how it affects you. A step-aunt's autistic son went from unmanagable to a sweetheart by removing processed carbohydrates from his diet. No toast in the morning, no pasta in the evening, and suddenly his mother's living hell became a relative paradise.<p>When in doubt, remove all the artificial, pre-processed crap foods from your diet. Shop, as one poster suggested, on the outside walls of the grocery store – meat, fish, poultry, vegetables. Try taking dairy out of your diet. Try taking sausages. I can't digest animal fats, so both of these are bad ideas for me. Same with bacon. Try taking things out. Reconsider everything in your diet, and don't be afraid to play around. Add things, remove things. Read other people's experiences. Make notes, and learn from them. Build hypotheses and test them. Approach it like a science experiment, because that's really what it is.",1254721623

There is a major political force that fights <i>for</i> the circumstances that he finds (and I find) so objectionable.<p>In this mentally defective ""progressive"" movement--that can't tell the difference between helping the poor and helping poverty--cleaning up bad neighborhoods is called ""gentrification"" and fought tooth and nail. Likewise any plan to fight homelessness that isn't some variation of ""give the homeless more free money."" The result is a massive political deadlock between two sides that can never agree on anything. Perpetual warfare.<p>The situation is, in reality, both much better and much worse than he understands. Better because we're not a city full of selfish bohemians. Worse because we are a backwards, provincial city with a deeply broken political culture.<p>But, even though I also hate victorian architecture, I can't think of anywhere else I would rather live. Portland is way too homogenous and small-town for me.<p>Edit: btw, I love my transit situation. I use a combination of bicycle (mostly), City CarShare (a fleet of cars at my disposal), Muni trains, and cabs. Not owning a car is a fairly high priority for me.

861266,comment,860913.0,860913.0,0,0,davidw,,,"That really rings true for me.<p>I enjoyed my time in San Francisco, but really got a sense that it was not a place in ""equilibrium"", so to speak.  Families can't really live there unless there's a million dollars for a house somewhere, which means that you have to be pretty wealthy, or you're headed out to some other city in the bay area.  SF was great for being single, but it just struck me as being a bit artificial.  Here in Padova, there are wealthy people, poor people, young people, families, elderly people - a nice mix, in other words.  Same with Portland.<p>Also, he's right about so many people being in tech.  Here in Padova, I have more friends who aren't in tech, and that makes me happy - I love to hang out with my tech friends too, and talk about this or that, but sometimes it's nice to get away from that, and in SF I never felt I could, despite trying.<p>That said, as someone born and raised in Oregon, I just don't think I could deal with moving back to the rainy part of the state.  Endless drizzly gray days get pretty depressing.  They don't even feel very 'cozy'; winter in Innsbruck was way better; watching the snow fall or waking up to a brilliant blue day with snow covered mountains was much better than sloshing around in the dismal gray day after day.<p>I'm actually not sure where I'd go if I went back to the US.  Southern Oregon is nice in some ways, but not much going on at all in tech.  Boulder looks appealing in several ways, but I've never been there, and it looks like they have a strong sense of 'smug' of their own, something I'm not a big fan of.<p><i>Edit</i> Let's see... other random notes<p>* Portland, for me, had better food than SF.  This was because I worked downtown in Portland and had a nice variety of affordable and diverse lunch options.  Where I worked in SF didn't have nearly as good a selection.<p>* Portland has Powells.  Powells is awesome.<p>* Portland is closer to more outdoor stuff, although I always got depressed in summer because of the thought of my precious few sunny days slipping by sitting in an office.

Lauderdale to partying on South Beach and hanging out in Coconut Grove, to walking through the streets of NY and Chicago, the streets are dirty with trash and other random crap. And don't even get me started on the homeless problem in Miami. They make the homeless folk here in SF look like suburbanites.<p>The air in SF is very, very clean. Its largely due to the constant breeze from the Pacific. Down in the valley is a bit different and gets pretty smoggy at times.<p>Basically, there is no where else that I want to be. The culture out here is fantastic. The people ARE FRIENDLY. I live in Lower Haight and have never been mugged, robbed, or anything. Its pretty easy to stay safe here, just like anywhere.

I am against state owned companies, but in this case I know that the real reason behind the push for privatization is to allow some politicians and their friends to keep on stealing money from Pemex while they reduce the danger of being unmasked (it is practically impossible to audit a large organization where some parts are government owned while other parts are owned by private international corporations).",1254718893
