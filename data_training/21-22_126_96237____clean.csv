When a new industrial sector emerges, people will get rich, and, well... welcome to the information age.<p>I think that hackers, however, have an appreciation for the system. Hackers want to learn about complex systems work, but they have a profound respect for those complex systems. Thus, they're not engaged in the business of getting rich no matter what the cost to others.<p>All the people I know who only want to get rich end up in jobs that promise that. But they are all jobs that reek of unsustainability, like wall street traders and dot-com-type startups with a lot of hype and no business model or valuable contribution to society.

There are many self-consistent moral systems starting with different axioms that produce different results. None of these systems is better than the others. Rather, each of these axioms represent something that humans value. They produce contradictory results, but this is not unexpected for reasons previously stated.<p>For what it's worth, I bought pretty much everything Rand ever wrote and quite a few things by Peikoff. I used to hand out copies of Anthem to friends. It was ideas such as I stated above that lead me away from objectivism. Roughly, I have a different idea of what kind of a beast a human is, and what kind of structure morality is.<p>Also, I think what the average person feels is right is very pertinent to the discussion of ethics. Attempts to find an objective standard of moral value beyond what humans actually value are usually flimsy and involve a lot of purposeful ignoring of flaws.",1235943905

With App Engine, I have to deal with all of the small quirks of their data store.<p>Examples:<p>You are doing something location-based and what to find things within 10 miles of a location.  With SQL, you can do a crude bounding box query if it doesn't have to be that accurate.  You can even do better geometric queries with PostGIS.  With App Engine, you can't even do a bounding box query.  Inequality queries can only be on one field at a time.  Beyond the location example, you can't say get me the items where comment_count > 5 and author_karma > 10.<p>You can't do joins and so you have to denormalize a lot of data that will perform fine as normalized data.<p>There is no OR operator at all.<p>Saying that it allows you to ignore the messy details is like saying that you can avoid having to get egg on your fingers making an omelet if you create a machine that can automatically create food.  It is <i>not</i> easier to go with App Engine for the majority of applications which would benefit from simple things that App Engine doesn't support.<p><i>It is far easier to scale something written for App Engine.</i>  That's the payoff.  Even if you have to port away from App Engine, you've still created a data storage strategy that doesn't require joins; you've still moved a lot of the data processing out of the database and into Python manually; you've still made it so that you aren't using any advanced queries.  App Engine forces you to write applications in a way that scales.  App Engine doesn't allow you to do any of the operations that make programming quick to do.
