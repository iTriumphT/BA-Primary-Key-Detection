The closest is the initial Louisiana attorney, but even there it's clear the main motivation is resentment -- and the ""give it all away"" comment is hyperbole.<p>Meanwhile, the tax accountant quoted on page 2 allows that it's <i>possible</i> a discontinuity with regard to deductions could create a situation where you would net more by reducing your income. The tax code is gigantic and buggy; it's not out of the question that a few taxpayers, in certain narrow situations, sometimes face marginal rates over 100%.<p>In any case, my point is not with an overly-literal interpretation of the ABC story. It's that this parade of commentators throwing around words like 'idiot' -- starting with Chait at the TNR piece and continuing here -- are the real know-nothings.<p>This taxpayer behavior is not idiotic; it's evolved human behavior, in the presence of perceived unfairness, that may serve long-term survival strategies.",1236113951

So you may have a pretty good reading on the mentality of the networks here.<p>I'm not sure they're quite that sophisticated, though.  I think they're reasoning is more along the lines of ""I own that, <i>I</i> decide how and when it will be viewed!""  Kind of a total war mentality, where they're even willing to shoot themselves in the foot to defend copyright.<p>I don't know much about copyright law, but this behavior does seem to run counter to the <i>spirit</i> of the law, which is to encourage the creation and dissemination of content by granting a ""temporary"" monopoly for the creator.  In theory, this would expand the amount of content available to the public.  But what I constantly encounter is the use of copyright to <i>restrict</i> access to content by limiting what I can view, see, hear, or read - as well as attacking the technologies that promote the dissemination of content because they are used (extensively, I admit) for copyright violation.<p>It's all gone so wrong.  Because congress has shown a willingness to grant extensions to copyrights that were set to expire, and the supreme court has decided that copyrights with repeated extensions don't qualify as copyrights in perpetuity, it's hard to believe that the monopoly is temporary.  For all practical purposes, it's permanent - and the copyright cartel is more than willing to use them to shut down the tech factor.<p>I do agree with PG that there's no turning back the tide.

501916,comment,501696.0,501696.0,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"This is many years premature. It may come to pass, but is nowhere near that now. TV is still by far the most common way of watching television shows (and watching television shows is still the most common way of wasting time) and overall viewership is increasing every year. This trend doesn't seem to be changing for a few reasons.<p>1) TV screens are much bigger and cheaper. They don't need the resolution a monitor does. Watching on a small screen is something you're happy to be able to do on a plane, but would never want to do on a day to day basis.<p>2) Bandwidth is still not there, especially for HDTV, and progress seems to be stalled. I still have pretty much the same connection for the same price that I did 5 years ago, and I'll likely still have it in 5 years from now. Mark Cuban talks about this a lot. Fiber to the premises may solve this one soon for some subset of the country, but by no means everyone.<p>3) Live television is nearly non-existent online. It can't handle it. The bandwidth to stream the Superbowl to everyone who wants it doesn't exist. Sports are a huge part of the TV viewing audience.<p>4) Many people like to watch shows as soon as they're released. The internet is terrible for this. I personally download mine, but I do so knowing that I'm always going to be watching the Daily Show from 2 days ago. If I were a TV addict (i.e. normal American) that would be unacceptable.<p>5) Content quality is better than ever. Single camera sitcoms, pay channel dramas, reality tv (if you're into that). Almost everyone agrees this is a golden era of television.<p>If you really think that more people are watching TV on a computer than on a good old-fashioned TV, you need to come down from your Silicon Valley mountain for a while.",1236112053
