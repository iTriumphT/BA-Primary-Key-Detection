I eventually went with CLISP and PLT (Racket).<p>Issues like hygiene didn't really bother me too much. As long as you are aware of it its not an issue.<p>While I really like the power of Lisp/Scheme (especially macros), I find that for most programming task Python or Ruby are good enough. There was an interesting post along similar lines 'Why Ruby is an acceptable Lisp'[1].<p>One thing I am really interested is in seeing how Perl 6 works out. It supports Lisp style macros (by making the parser available to the programmer) while using conventional syntax. While I am a Python fanboy myself I would seriously consider Perl 6 once there is a CPython grade implementation available.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-a...</a>",1280400979

The major advantage that a GUI has over a text interface is that it's more discoverable and given that most people these days have grown up around GUI's, we thus find text based UI's intimidating.<p>Either way, as developers, most of our day to day tasks revolve around editing text, so I'd say that using a tool that's aimed at giving us maximum textual love is a good thing.",1280398786

The game programmers had their starving families but I was in no position whatsoever to really make any real difference there.<p>But the thing is that I always bought <i>some</i> games.<p>Sometimes I bought one game per year, or maybe it was three per year some other year, depending on how much money I happened to get for my birthday. Further, it wasn't so much because I wanted to altruistically feed the programmer's family but that I saw value in owning an original copy of a really good game, with the box and the manuals, and I recognized the value of the programmers' work: the entertainment that came with a really good game.<p>If I had been the rich kid down the block I could have bought 10 or 30 games a year. But I wasn't and I was conscientiously happy to pay for what I could and pirate the rest.<p>This brings me to the software market as I want to see it.<p>The market is a pool of games and software, unfortunately priced so that only some people can buy them. And some people who might buy some, can't legally copy and try it out before deciding to buy or not. Therefore, I see value in considering games and software, in the end, more like common goods to which everyone has <i>some</i> rights. Not perhaps as important rights as to roads and water, but as something that costs zero to copy software begs for common copyrights.<p>And if it is so, the only way to pay for such thing is the pay-what-you-can model. You can't force people to buy your stuff anyway. I believe that the market, together with piracy, already exhibits this property quite strongly.",1280398447

It costs people like 0.20 cents to call someone with a phone, and I pay like 0.25 cents or something. When I used to have a phone in Germany, I used to spend upwards of 90 euros a month calling like I was used to in the states, where I basically have as much calling as I need for $50 (including tax and all that sneaky bullshit).  Cell phones in europe are a little cheaper if you don't talk much, but if you really want to use it as a primary phone, they are insane expensive.

A tip if you really want to quit: don't rationalize, there is no rational reason to smoke, i smoke because i enjoy it, and the joy is just a chemical reaction in my brain. Don't rationalize, there is no rational reason. Just quit and be done with it. Don't think too much. Best way to kill an addiction is to starve it.",1280397783

Software was pirated, almost by everybody. It was priced for companies, not for normal people, because everybody assumed it will be only bought by companies who need it, private people would pirate it, and they did.\nEarnings are up today, but kids are used to pirating things. Still, when game is sold with reasonable price (I would say 5-10$) it isn't pirated by normal people, only jerks who won't buy anything no matter what.\nI would say in my region people crossed the line between ""piracy is neccesity"" to ""piracy is easy"" in the last 10 years.
