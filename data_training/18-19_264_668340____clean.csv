None of the boring normal bugs cost my mom her credit score or, for the months it takes to resolve the problem, her savings account balance. There has also never ever ever been an X11 bug that took down the Internet.<p>There is also a CS-theoretic difference between ""all the boring normal bugs"" that emerge during variations of normal use cases, and the much larger, much harder to model class of byzantine failures that occur only when components of the system are forced to operate at odds with the the system as a whole. Security failures are byzantine failures. They are, at the very least, extremely difficult to predict and plan for.",1216234773

247834,comment,247753.0,247753.0,0,0,tptacek,,,"The fundamental dispute here is that security researchers want Linus to take a vow of silence on any bug they report to him, which vow extends all the way into how Linus manages the git repositories.<p>Look, there are two ways to read this comment from Linus.<p>On the one hand, there's the batshit crazy read, which sincerely believes that data theft, fraud, and privacy violations are on equal footing with performance, reliability, or even data corruption problems. The difference between security flaws and bugs is that <i>bugs don't have adversaries behind them</i>.<p>But all that really tells us is that Linus has never talked to anybody who worked for a bank.<p>On the other hand, there's the weary pragmatist's read, which understands what 15 years of withering pompousness from security experts takes out of a development team. These are people who not only want their bugs at the front of the line, but have talking points for Linus to adhere to at the same time.<p>It's refreshing to see him tell my industry to fuck off. We deserve it.<p>T'so has the final, true, correct read on this. It's not Linus' job to manage Linux security. There are hundreds of people better situated to do that job. If you don't want Linus spilling the beans on your press release advisory, don't let Linus find out about it. Problem solved.",1216234610

However, the curiculum I was <i>forced</i> to teach was all this foreshadowing/theme/theory crap.<p>2) I quit to write software.<p>3) I would have been overjoyed had my students made the kind of grammar mistake (student's) I made in my off the cuff remark. In fact, my experience doing this has made me incredibly forgiving for this kind of thing, I guess in my own writing as well as that of others. Basically, if the meaning is clear and obvious I don't really consider it a mistake, just being a pedantic snob. The problem you get with people who really don't know how to write is the meaning isn't clear, I mean <i>really</i> not clear. You get, like, word salad, metaphors so brutally mixed that who knows what point was trying to be made, a level of incoherence that truly impedes what is trying to be communicated -- it can range from severe annoyance to total incomprehension.
