I&#x27;m not worried about the individuals opening up their routers, there is always a risk, but that can be mitigated.

The two big things we should be doing - ECC ram and checksumming filesystems - are still nowhere close to being mainstream.<p>I recently bought and returned three(!) 3TB drives because I found they were silently corrupting data every 500GB of writes, or so (verified by testing on multiple systems) - I switched to 2TB from another brand, and had zero issues. I only knew there was a problem because I wrote a burn-in script to copy & verify over and over. File system, OS does not care. It&#x27;s the drive&#x27;s job.<p>Almost every USB stick I&#x27;ve ever used eventually had some small corruption issue - again, no way to catch this unless you are looking for this kind of thing.<p>Average consumer does not think this is even possible - the idea of your data silently getting scrambled seems impossible, like a car randomly being unable to break - it is just assumed this sort of thing does not happen. But as hard drives get bigger and people put more RAM in their systems I think this will become a huge issue. Of course, consumers will blame &quot;a virus&quot; or something along those lines.",1402459127

In my experience with the medium sized projects I&#x27;ve been closely responsible for (in the hundreds of thousands of lines ballpark), we were interested in doing a really good job in both the exception and the error result cases, because the misbehavior scenario is a real issue, and followed all the good practices in the modern developer&#x27;s backpack. In the end, exception-rich code just turned out obviously hard to get right, no matter how much we _wanted_ to get it right, because the program is allowed to jump out of arbitrary stack frames that the developer was conveniently taught to not handle errors on, because.. hey! the &quot;default behavior&quot;!<p>After getting involved in these experiments, I started paying more attention to how people can possibly be happy with exception-rich logic that behaves like that.

Artists often change the way they produce art midway through their career. Ever listen to juvenalia by Beethoven, Brahms, or Strauss? Ever listen to early Stravinsky and compare it to what he was writing in the 1960s? Ever look at what Picasso was doing before his primitivist paintings? They all completely changed over the course of their careers, and they all had a moment in their career when they starting making art that was in their voice.<p>So seeing someone get better at something like painting mid-career doesn&#x27;t indicate to me some deus ex machina, just the gradual accumulation of skill and judgement, until it finally clicks and a mature artist is born.<p>This is not proof that you&#x27;re wrong, I just want to know why you jump to that conclusion when there seems to be a perfectly normal explanation.",1402458232

First of all, it appears that state law determines whether or not non-compete clauses are even legal or enforceable. If you are currently living and working in California, for example, you most likely have nothing to worry about.<p>I have always found the following to be a the best approach in a situation such as this... During contract negotiations, provide a list of &#x27;prior inventions&#x27; which are excluded from any non-compete agreement. In Europe this is standard practice, especially when contracting. Secondly, while under contract, and, when you are about to embark upon a new personal project, get sign-off from your manager that these efforts do not create a conflict of interest in your current role at the company.<p>There are multiple reasons for you to make sure that you dot the i&#x27;s and cross the t&#x27;s! You want to make sure that your employer is aware of the multitude of talents you exhibit and is aware of the products you are developing. And for you, it is imperative to make sure that whatever it is you are doing does not constitute a breach of contract. I believe that the benefits and hazards are obvious to this approach.<p>Finally, I would like to emphasize that your decision to contribute to the success of a company is not a one way street! When embarking upon contract negotiations or re-negotiations as described above, you need to make sure that you fully support your own decision to continuing to help your employer grow. If there is little to no support for the personal growth in which you are interested, you should terminate the contract and, if appropriate, find an employer who does support you as you support them.<p>Frank.",1402457021

His name is derived from The Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s drummer, Mitch Mitchell, and originally was &quot;Mitchiell Mitchie&quot; before shortening it. He started composing songs in high school in a band which made covers. However, he wanted to write his own songs. His biggest influence is Tom Jobim. He uses Logic Pro 9 to compose his songs. Mitchie M&#x27;s popularity is steady with most of his videos quickly gaining at least 200,000+ views.&quot;<p>This hints at part of the magic of Vocaloid: It gives the inexperienced, unknown, or unconnected a pitch-perfect (if a bit robotic-sounding) vocalist to experiment with, significantly expanding the range of genres a lone musician can cover. The take a relative &quot;outsider&quot; can have on pop music is very interesting, something of a middle ground between &quot;mass-produced&quot;/&quot;commercialized&quot; pop and the more experimental, &quot;underground&quot; electronic music you usually hear from solo acts.",1402456175

For instance, suppose you want to add a non-keyword argument, you&#x27;ll have to carefully grep for all calls.<p>I think functions should be either full keyword arguments and naming them in calls should be mandatory. Or no keyword arguments at all. The mixing of both is &quot;convenient&quot; for prototyping, but has a high long-term cost.<p>Unused imports:<p>In a module bar, you have `import foo`.
