162143,comment,161731.0,161754.0,0,0,xenoterracide,,,why not? I have done my best to let go of caring what people think of me or my work. I will stand behind it. If there is a problem and I fix it.,1208048081
162142,comment,161563.0,161728.0,0,0,queensnake,,,"Yeah - in the interview for my current C++ job, they asked not one question about C++. Now, it might be surmised that they could tell I was reasonable by my resume but in fact, the level of their code was (is) quite low, and (I swear!) some of the ppl are curious about this newfangled 'STL' thing. Yup yup yup. And, it is indeed a corporate job.",1208047957

Check hardforum's Displays section - good widescreen monitors start at $700 (since most of the 21-22"" panels are TN)",1208047801

If I get to the movie's five minutes before you, and take a seat you may have wanted, I'm not violating any of your rights of free choice because I parked my ass in a chair before you could.",1208047608

162138,comment,162035.0,162101.0,0,0,pg,,,"That first batch was actually great.  It had both Reddit and Loopt in it, plus Firecrawl, which morphed into Textpayme, plus Justin and Emmett, who went on to do Justin.TV after selling Kiko.<p>Reddit was a merger of 2 startups from that batch, so if you count Loopt as a success (a fairly safe bet), 4/8 succeeded: Reddit, Infogami, Textpayme, and Loopt.  I'd be delighted if we managed to achieve a 50% success rate ongoing.",1208047067

162136,comment,161731.0,161848.0,0,0,sayrer,,,"I usually learn from these essays, but I've always found them somewhat grating. Some perceive the style as confrontational, but I think that's unreasonable intellectual defensiveness that pg so often picks apart.<p>These deletions have helped me realize why these essays bother me, on a stylistic level. The cadence is very regular and robotic. It's easy to anticipate the switches from descriptions of conventional wisdom to a different way of framing the problem, and easy to anticipate that there will be a conventional wisdom to roast.",1208046897

162134,comment,161731.0,161895.0,0,0,pg,,,"You get better at deletion.  When you first start writing, it's hard to delete stuff because it cost you a lot of effort to write it.  As you get more confident, you get more ruthless in that respect: ""This is crap.  Out with it.""<p>Editing is writing, however, and the hardest part of writing is thinking. I don't feel I've gotten much better at that.",1208046380

I second that it is intense.  I accomplish much more than I would by myself, but I always feel very used up afterwards.",1208046157
162132,comment,161731.0,161923.0,0,0,pg,,,"Interesting question.  I think it would be hard.  Maybe you could leave in occasional chatty bits to preserve that tone, at the cost of only a little extra length.",1208046028

162130,comment,161927.0,161927.0,0,0,siblog,,,"Like many have said it is all a personal preference. You will get reasons from Mac users why OSX is better and you will get reasons from Linux users why Ubuntu is better......both are great Operating Systems, but in the end it is just a personal preference.<p>And like others have also said I think the best way to figure out which you like better is to dual boot. Try both the GNOME and KDE environments too.<p>I personally have been using Linux/Ubuntu for the last 2 years and have not found anything that I can not do that I absolutely need. I love the ability to customize everything.<p>In the end the reason I prefer Linux/Ubuntu is because I like the FOSS ideology and the people/community behind it. I can find a free Open Source application for almost everything, and if I have an issue I have thousands of Linux users who have probably already come across it and know how to solve it. The community has also put together a great idea-brainstorming site called Ubuntu Brainstorm to better improve the OS for the users. Oh and Ubuntu 8.04 comes out in just a few days!",1208045856
162129,comment,162098.0,162123.0,0,0,maxwell,,,"I did it for a college project once. It was fun, mostly because we were building something we already had defined, so it was just a matter of implementation and mutually learning the environment (we were using Max/MSP). It probably worked because we were in unfamiliar territory; if we both knew the lang inside and out, I bet we would have just bitten off a bigger chunk and each done our own portion and evolved it further.<p>I don't think I could do it on a significant project, because I'm always making a bunch of tiny changes that I wouldn't want to have to explain/suggest. Collaboration on a single problem is helpful. Collaboration on a single work of art isn't always. Could you imagine pair painting?",1208045607

162126,comment,161980.0,161980.0,0,0,mrtron,,,"It could be the brightness.<p>I am going to go with a random guess here:  You have large pupils.  I have large pupils myself and it was actually a slight risk for laser eye surgery and my night vision is a bit blurred (not from the laser eye, from the large pupils).  I find most new LCDs too bright and it hurts my eyes.  I am forced to turn down my new HDTV to 50% brightness!<p>So, turn down the brightness and be careful with laser eye to ensure the equipment is suitable for large pupils (most newer lasers do a much larger radius than the first ones).<p>Or, I am way off and its something else :)",1208045213
