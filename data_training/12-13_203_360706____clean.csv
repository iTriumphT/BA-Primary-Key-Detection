All the examples cited by the OP are considerably more different from the original than the image in question.<p>To get more clearly into the category of ""fair use"", I would think the art would need more significant differentiation.  To an unexpert eye, these might be things like:\n- Variation of the palette into something typical of an NES game\n-  Revisit the perspective to make it more two-dimensional, as an older video game would (the image clearly depicts Davis at an angle in a way we wouldn't have expected in an 80s game console)\n-  More exaggerated usage of ""pixelized"" elements\n-  Introduction of elements / themes /motifs from other pixel art pieces\n-  Turn the image upside down, put curious, ""where the hell am I?"" look on Davis' face\n-  Pixelized chipmunk \n-  Pixelized Thelonious Monk<p>If the idea here wasn't to invest a lot of time into the image itself, and have some that plays the marketing role of 1950s cover art, then do something evocative but more clearly distinct.<p>Finding the line between ""derivative"" and ""creative"" is not a computable problem.  But it gets a lot easier with the quality of the art.  But it seems to me the photographer has a point.

Not wanting to become type-cast as a Windows guy, I chose to do it on a unix based system. For this, I use an Ubuntu image in Virtual Box, and have been very happy.<p>> I just feel 'safer' in Windows.<p>I guess I could say I'm the same, though I think its more down to simply preferring Windows 7's UI/UX over the likes of Gnome and KDE. I've also tried customising a whole variety Linux window mangers, but always gave up.<p>So what I'm doing now is using Virtual Box in headless mode, then ssh-ing in with X-forwarding enabled. This gives me new icons in Windows 7's task bar for every 'remote' Linux window I have open. (though really I don't use much more than a terminal and maybe gvim). To an observer looking over my shoulder, it would just appear that the 'remote' Linux applications are native Windows programs.<p>[edit] I didn't really address your point about the learning curve to learning a new OS. This is valid issue and all I can suggest is to give it a try, and using a VM is an easy way to just dip in. You can get pre-installed Virtual Box images for many Linux distros such that it is really easy to get started.
