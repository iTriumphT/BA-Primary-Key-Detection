Are placebos also effective when you know fully well that you take nothing more than a sugar pill? I don't think so.,1262689055

1032186,comment,1031540.0,1032143.0,0,0,DrJokepu,,,That really depends on the query and the data structures used in the database. You can query large amounts of data on the hard drive very quickly if you store your data and indexes in data structures manually tuned for the problem. Modern operating systems / databases will try to use up your available RAM anyway to cache hard drive so keeping the whole database in RAM (if it fits into the RAM) won't help that much anyway.,1262688171
