When filesystem-level corruption occured, the backup script overwrote a good (perhaps 1 day old) backup file with a corrupted file, so he's backup was worthless.<p>The first thing that comes to mind is that he could have used application-level backup, ie. Mysql. The script would have noticed that the DB is corrupted because reads (SELECT) would have failed, and the backup script would have stopped and sent him an email to restore the good backup file.<p>If he used a cloud service like Amazon SimpleDB, he wouldn't have to worry about filesystem-level corruption, because that's abstracted away by Amazon. (And it's replicated.)<p>This is still not enough though. What if the site gets hacked and the hacker issues DELETE statements. Then all your data is deleted, and even if you have application-level backup, it will succeed (it will read the empty DB), thus overwriting your old backup.<p>I guess the conclusion is to keep around several copies of the data, and have sanity-checks in place to avoid overwriting good backups. In his case it was hard (given it's a homegrown application) to keep around many copies, because his DB was 500G in size.",1234813498

However that is and has always been a less common strategy: most 'bulge bracket' firms (active fund of $300-600m) don't invest such small amounts.<p>More generally, no, I do not see any trend in rounds getting significantly smaller. I do see a trend in pre-money valuations coming down, of course, but that's entirely different.<p>The economics of bulge-bracket VC work when you invest say ~5% of your fund in each portfolio company, in the hope that 1/10 or 1/20 of your companies will hit it out of the park. Total fund size equilibriates when drivers for scale (partners' remuneration, principally, less relatively invariable overheads) balances with diseconomies from political inference effects which kick in when too many partners try to reach consensus and cut the cake. That's why top tier firms with a 'plain vanilla' strategy have roughly comparable fund sizes.<p>FUD aside, nothing I'm seeing at the moment that gives me any reason to believe that underlying model is 'broken' or failing (though of course '07 and '08 vintages will be shot). Almost all successful start-ups need a lot of money to scale beyond a certain point. Free software doesn't really change the cost of airtime, or a VP bus dev. I'm writing anonymously so I have no real axe to grind in saying that.<p>What is certainly happening in the industry is a shake-out. Good firms with strong reputations are raising quickly and comfortably (if quietly because it's not a time to be above the parapet), and will continue to invest without interruption. That is because there are well-priced deals to do in this environment, and innovation doesn't stop in a recession.<p>A number of 2nd tier firms, on the other hand, are finding fundraising very difficult. Many will not survive.<p>Firms that are thriving seem to be investing more slowly just at the moment. This is because there is a lot of noise in the market, and visibility is currently low. Analogy: when it's foggy you drive slower. (Economically: transaction costs rise as expectations less aligned, so liquidity declines.)<p>What is tough is the squeeze at the bottom end for start-ups. I get the impression (though have less direct evidence of this) that there is a bit less easy money on offer from HNWs sub $500k as many are licking wounds, etc.",1234813181
