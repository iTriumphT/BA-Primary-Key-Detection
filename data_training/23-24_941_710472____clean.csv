This certainly replaces a little pocket notebook, but personally I don't use pocket notebooks. I'd like something to replace a full-sized notebook: easy to type on, basically just good for text, sort of a portable digital typewriter.<p>Anyone know any good resources for larger screens? I'm curious if you can get 7"" + screens with slightly better refresh rates than eInk, but not as power-hungry as a full-color backlit display. The perfect screen would be something like the TI-86, except 8 times as large. Does anyone make 1000-2000 character displays in a 7-14 inch form factor?<p>I feel like you ought to be able to make something like  with 30-40 hours battery life (if not better) for around $200-$300.",1338767975

The sentiment is that gender imbalance is a problem that needs to be fixed. And as you say, any other reason goes out of the window.<p>I'm also of the opinion that there's a hint of arrogance in saying that men are the reason there are fewer women in the field. I generally take a feminist stance with these things, and am of the opinion that women's jobs being at the mercy of chauvinistic 'brogrammers' or some such bullshit is exactly that: bullshit.<p>Given the desire and the determination, any woman interested in the field can pursue a career in it, and the field does not prevent that.<p>> <i>""For Yeung, having parents who were both engineers spared her the sense that computers weren't for girls.""</i><p>This conveys the real truth, hiding in the mound of rubbish that is the majority of that article.<p>It's not Silicon Valley's fault; it's not the fault of technology, or programming; it's not the fault of the men working in those fields. It's <i>society's</i> fault for dictating what qualifies as 'girly', and what doesn't. Tech is not 'girly', therefore society fails to provide the same incentives to pursue those interests to young girls, that are available to young boys.",1338767970

And assuming none of my school teachers were engineers, I didn't encounter my first (known to me) engineer until I got to college.

People in poor countries just can't afford to pay what it costs to develop a drug, and the US has only so much influence when it comes to drug patents.  Witness India's abrogation of patents on AIDS drugs.  When you're Pfizer and Canada tells you ""this is what we're willing to pay for your drug.  If you don't don't like it we'll just invalidate your patent and give you nothing"" you take what you can get.<p>>After all, the cancer market is so small, only one third of the entire population has cancer at any given time, it might take them more than a year to start making net profit.<p>A third of the population has cancer?  Not even close.  Cancer prevalence in the US is something like 12 million people,<p><a href=""http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerBasics/cancer-prevalence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerBasics/cancer-prevalence</a><p>out of a population of about 314 million, which works out to something less than a 4%.<p>And there is no ""cancer market"".  Cancer is a class of diseases.  This drug is specifically designed to treat prostate cancer (which is itself not one disease but a class of different types of cancers that start in the prostate) that has metastasized, which isn't even most prostate cancer patients.  So no, this isn't Lipitor or the next big allergy medication.  They're not going to sell this to very many people, and the people who take it are very sick, so most of them won't be taking it for very long.<p>>Please stop defending and apologizing for billionaires.<p>Name one person who made a billion dollars in legal pharmaceuticals.

Again, this is a familiar issue to people who are familiar with linguistics, and one of the criticisms of the Rao et al. publication is that none of the authors are familiar with the methodology used in historical linguistics to solve comparable problems in other parts of the world. (I am able to read ancient Chinese and am intimately familiar with the history of the Chinese script, which is an illuminating example for comparing periods of early ornamentation, proto-writing, and full writing as that script developed with attested archeological finds.) I am also very familiar with the extent of the Indo-European languages and with the fact that many languages spoken in India (e.g., Tamil, a language spoken by many friends of mine) are not Indo-European. The links I already provided give much of the needed background information.<p>But here are a few more links, for onlookers who are curious about this issue and may be interested in responses to the Rao et al. publication.<p><a href=""http://www.safarmer.com/Refutation3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.safarmer.com/Refutation3.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.safarmer.com/more.on.Rao.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.safarmer.com/more.on.Rao.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://horadecubitus.blogspot.com/2009/04/indus-what-did-rao-et-al-really-do.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://horadecubitus.blogspot.com/2009/04/indus-what-did-rao...</a><p><a href=""http://earningmyturns.blogspot.com/2009/04/falling-for-magic-formula.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earningmyturns.blogspot.com/2009/04/falling-for-magic...</a><p>(The link immediately above is by a former president of the Society for Computational Linguistics.)<p><a href=""http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/coli_a_00011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/coli_a_00011</a><p>(The review article linked above from the journal Computational Linguistics discussed the methodological issues involved.)",1338767748

So though the evidence of mixing with Denisovans exists in Asia, with the Neanderthals in Europe, and with Homo floresiensis in the islands, in modern human fossil records (which seem to originate from Africa) apparently traces of each still exist.<p>Thus, one might conclude that either recent mixing has reintroduced these genes back into our most common ancestors, or that the distant mixing occurred in a period that we no longer have evidence of (but might in the future).",1338767634

4062012,comment,4060264.0,4061801.0,11,0,grellas,,,"In the federal courts, I think it is more a matter of philosophy than of economic necessity. Unlike state courts, federal courts use the single-judge calendar system, meaning that any given case is assigned to one judge for all purposes from beginning to end. This means that a judge who is proactive in managing cases will reap direct rewards in keeping his docket under control. In addition, federal judges sit for life and cannot be removed except for grounds justifying impeachment. They thus has <i>enormous</i> power and some run their courts almost like little fiefdoms (or at least it seems that way!). When they want to twist arms, the parties have little choice but to comply, even as they might buck and kick in the process. In any case, when high-powered lawyers and their litigant clients come into federal court and try to muscle the court and the other parties, the judge has a basic choice: do I let this go on unchecked or do I set a tone by which I control things. Eventually, the judges realized that they had to be aggressive in setting the right tone and this in time became the norm with many of them. It definitely ties in with the idea of not letting the courts be completely overwhelmed but it is not budget-driven as such but rather is motivated by necessities of reining in cases (and lawyers and parties) that would otherwise run wild to the detriment of the judge and his docket. Today, federal judges will vary on how much they use such power to curtail abuse and to promote aggressive management but the trend is very much, as you say, toward proactive management.",1338765389
