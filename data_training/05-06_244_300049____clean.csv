478098,comment,477435.0,478015.0,0,0,tptacek,,,"Sometimes storing session data serverside is clunky, particularly when you have multiple servers; a classic, reasonable approach in that case is to MAC the contents of the cookie with a 256-bit random key, and then AES-CBC encrypt the cookie with that same key. But I agree, for this app, there's no reason there should be structured data in a cookie.<p>As for the room IDs --- randomizing them is a fine bit of rubber-chicken security. I think it's a good idea. But the right solution is to allow users to erase the chat logs, and to verify that users have access to a given room before dumping all messages starting at message ID 0.",1234418328

Since then I've periodically lost the ability to speak. I go from normal speech to slurring, to mute. Its being looked at, but the reason I made this thread is because... I realized that it is exactly like TCP packets overloading the sliding window, or a web server with limited resources getting too many requests: overload the throughput on the queue and everything after that is lost.<p>So I made a diagram tonight when I had a bad episode to prove I can still think.<p>When things are bad, and I fill the shrunken word queue, I can't speak until it self empties. Full empty seems to take between 30 seconds and one minute, and seems to happen at a linear rate. However, if I limit myself to the actual word queue/minute throughput, I can speak continuously for a longer period. Normal speed speech very quickly fills the queue though.<p>Strange, but accurate. If my mind is a Turing Machine, my word queue is malfunctioning and is too small to hold enough words to speak normally.",1234417570

Graduate recruiting is <i>cyclical</i> and has <i>lag</i>, which are combining right now to make for tough conditions for milk-round applicants. If you dont get what you want now then start targeting the <i>off cycle</i> recruiting processes as as soon as you hear of their markets picking up. Once these companies see conditions improving they will be scrambling to hire all the people that they were no-so-long-ago scared to hire...<p>(Companies doing milkround recruiting (i.e. large companies, including consultancies and banks) typically set their targets for # of hires in advance of milkround cycle starting.

478059,comment,477865.0,477974.0,0,0,eande,,,“fact that diesel cars are usually more efficient...”\nis true if compared to a gasoline combustion engine. But there is no simple comparison on efficiency between the 2 different technology battery vs gasoline.<p>My take is the other way. Loan several billion dollar to any of the big three is not doing much. The cash burn rate they have will eat the money quickly and just to survive. Since the first oil crises in the ‘70 any of the Detroit companies had lots of time to spend R&D money on alternative power train solutions. They decided not to do a lot for multibillion dollar revenue companies other than building bigger and bigger SUVs. Japanese car manufacture by now have some lead in hybrid and battery technology and a small company Tesla has in my opinion a better chance to compete in this segment.,1234415312

""<p>It is decent certainly, but  nothing very ground breaking (imo) which is what  ""wizard"" would imply. In no field of endeavor I know do we call people ""wizards"" for mere competence. The term is (imho) reserved for people who do ground breaking things / display <i>astounding</i> levels of competence/performance. Iow, someone isn't  a ""wizard"" musician just because he knows his scales.<p>You express this much better as ""their code accomplished really new things, as opposed to finding better ways to do old things""). May be we just understand ""wizard"" differently, which is completely all right.<p>""Norvig wrote some good books, but I never really got the sense of how he approaches a problem from them, although I did like the AI stuff quite a bit.

The whole book is essentially Norvig programming ""blow by blow"" finding mistakes and reversing design decisions and so on.

That said, I don't find Martin's code to be particularly inspiring as compared to the other people I mentioned. I find Martin's  code to be <i>competent</i> but not ""wizard level"".

478056,comment,477622.0,478043.0,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Not 'totally true', but it was a lot more true in the past than it is today, logical block addressing on harddrives (especially PC drives, scsi and other non-consumer targeted drive architectures much less so) is a relatively new thing.<p>In the past the host did a lot more of the work that has now been offloaded to the drives, since IDE basically the whole controller moved off host onto the drive. The reasons are simple, tighter integration and lower costs as well as a uniform interface to the drive, no matter what goes on physically inside it. Nobody really cares! (well, drive manufacturers obviously do, but consumers will treat it like a black box, it either works or it doesn't, no much point in figuring out how it works).<p>So, flash in this sense is roughly where harddrives were in the times of the early winchester, you present a pretty rough device to the outside and the host has to know a lot about how it works to make it function.<p>SSDs are already changing this, the controller is built in now and the interface presented is very close to the one used by a normal harddrive, in fact most are indistinguishable. Even most usb sticks and the larger cards do a good job of hiding the gory details.<p>That full rotation business is not quite the whole story by the way, plenty of drives nowadays do not need to see the 'whole' track in order to do a simple read or write of a sector, they can optimize for that to the point that the sector will be just about ready to be read from or written to by the time the drive head arrives above the track.<p>Most drives try to avoid that situation as long as they can though, and most file systems do too by picking a block size that is a fairly large multiple of a sector.",1234415102
