257622,comment,257588.0,257588.0,0,0,ratsbane,,,Remarkable...  I wish the US system were more like that but I can't see it happening.  My high school was nothing like that.  Montessori schools seem to lean in that direction though.  Can anyone with first-hand Montessori experience comment on that?,1217091430

Your use of a sockpuppet account to do it makes it cheap as well. (Yes, the other guy did that too.) Most of what you're offering here is a personal emotional response. That would be more effective if you gave it content that wasn't so formulaic (reacting from a socially conforming position and expressing outrage that others have not done the same).<p>Your main point appears to be that you're angry with pg for not sharing your response and rushing to say so.

257601,comment,257439.0,257439.0,0,0,mdasen,,,"As someone who uses Django a lot:<p>1. Schema migrations aren't a big deal unless you don't know SQL.  Django just doesn't fit schema migration like Rails does either.  Django's models are written in Python and then the database is generated from them.  That means that changes have to be made in two places (Python and SQL).  Most of the solutions had things where renaming a column would involve something like address = models.CharField(max_length=255, old_name=""street_address"").  So, I have to do that, migrate it and then I just have this old_name in the model that's doing nothing so I have to remove it (or have the model look ugly).  SQL isn't so scary.<p>2/3: I don't use the admin interface for most of my projects so I guess these never bothered me that much.<p>5. I find the install easy.  apt-get install apache2 mod-wsgi and just create a virtual host.  Of course, it's probably a royal pain if you don't understand things like python paths, packages, or apache configurations.  It isn't harder than Rails et al, but it is harder than PHP.<p>6. I'm looking forward to 1.0 and releases coming regularly after that.",1217089099
