I grew up a lot writing about the experience. There were also some moments of personal vindication: After writing about a particularly assed argument with her re:music, I got a message from somebody who works on a major music site that vindicated my point of view a little.

713664,comment,713589.0,713643.0,0,0,jerf,,,"""Let me guess... it would only take about a weekend, right?""<p>Making a functional link redirector? Yes, absolutely. There are frameworks that you could toss something together with in an hour that would scale enough for most people's purposes. With some frameworks you can get pretty close to true internet-scale scalability in a weekend. (I'd think Yaws and Erlang here.) I've seen framework tutorials use this as the demo, and, again, we're talking things that can get awfully close to internet scale without much work.<p>Making all the stuff that apparently surround link redirectors in some desperate attempt to make it ""monetizable""? It would take longer, but unlike the case for ""replicating Stack Overflow"" where all the extra stuff is the real value and will take more than a weekend, that's all extra stuff that nobody really cares about very much in this case. A page that takes a URL, returns a URL, and does nothing else really is enough for the vast majority of uses.<p>It's a different class of problem. This truly <i>is</i> a fundamentally trivial problem. I personally see no reasonable way to ""monetize"" this trivial service, because the market value of a URL synonym is going to trend very strongly towards zero due to effectively infinite supply.<p>(Much as your point was that it's hard to recreate bit.ly rather than the weekend snark, note my point is more that doing that is a waste of time, mostly-crap features done to benefit the redirector, not the user, and that this truly <i>is</i> easy to recreate enough to drive supply sky-high.)",1248050497

713660,comment,713351.0,713351.0,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"Others have mentioned that there are different definitions of what ""design"" means, but I will assume you're talking primarily about visual/graphic design more so than the other ways the word is used.<p>As designers/developers or creative people in general, it's natural to think of our creations as art, they are.<p>But when it comes to art that has a concrete function, like websites, I find it helps me to remember that the average user will not be coming to a website I build for the sole purpose of marvelling at that lovely gradient that I made or that Ajax UI element that took me hours to put together. They're coming to the site to use a service or obtain information. That's all they're really interested in.<p>I'm not trying to say that the prettiness of the site doesn't matter, it does (for some sites more than others). But it's secondary to making sure the site is usable/accessible, making sure the visual design doesn't get in the way of what your users are trying to do. I'd also include in this making sure the design conveys the image you're tying to get across. That's part of the design not getting in your users way.<p>Users by and large will not squint at your visual design like you do and critique it in anywhere near as much detail as you might.",1248050319

Also, youth is boring compared with adulthood.<p>Consider grades K-6 where most students have little choice of what subjects to learn about, are often in the care of a single teacher for most of the day, and whose assignments involve lots of repetition (math drills, handwriting drills, spelling drills).  This <i>is</i> just plain boring, and so the mind works hard to avoid boredom by daydreaming, planning, etc... but still struggles to stave off boredom.<p>As we age we get more choice about what we want to do, and life gets a bit more dramatic and less boring.  I recall being bored during recess in grade school b/c I really didn't like tag or four square.  Put a mixed gender group of adults together and who knows what might happen.<p>So the increasing speed of the passage of time is a result both of life becoming less  boring and also of the <i>learned</i> ability to minimize boredom.  I read articles on my phone when waiting in line or when riding the muni.  In general most of my work and leisure time is highly focused to avoid boredom and thus just flies by.<p>Occasionally I have a reminder of how slowly time can pass -- such as when sitting in a waiting room with no reading material or poor quality reading material, etc.",1248048084
