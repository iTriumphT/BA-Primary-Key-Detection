I can't figure out what he's on about and I'm not especially motivated to, since I'm pretty sure he's looking for a pattern where none exists.<p>It looks to me as if inspiration and invention have happened throughout history independently of the circumstances of being employed by a company seeking to make patented and copyrighted products out of them, or being a hobbyist committed to sharing software.<p>PageRank is a ridiculous example.  Isn't it proprietary specifically to try to gain an advantage over Google spammers?  And why would a hobbyist start a PageRank-like project in the first place?  I'm not convinced Google's decision to keep it secret is optimal, given the success of free and open email spam filters, but they have enough smart people working there to come up with a reasonable solution to the problem anyway.<p>Speaking of spam filters, I'd say those represent a far better example of innovation than anything Lanier could think of, and virtually all of that innovation has happened in free software.",1199119147

The new frameworks allow you to do things in a matter of hours that would have taken weeks in the early days (possibly some personal skills bias is coming into play here too).<p>Try out something like RoR or Django.<p>I had the desire to write my own framework for many years, and completed a few half-baked frameworks, but it is definitely worthwhile considering one of the major frameworks.  There is a lot of time, thought and effort put into them that you can leverage!",1199118764
