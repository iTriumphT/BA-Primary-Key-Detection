They inevitably attempt to rationalize away our beliefs in an attempt to justify their own and in so doing, seem to make all sorts of assumptions of what believers (of all sorts) actually believe. This essay is no exception.<p>For example: The author says that people who believe in a here-after should be more willing to take risks (many are) but he doesn't take into account that many faiths consider unnecessary risks to be sinful in the same way that suicide is sinful, just to a much lesser degree. Also, regardless of what you believe about the after-life, death still signals the end of this one, which everyone is attached to in some way or another.<p>It's similar with lost loved-ones.
