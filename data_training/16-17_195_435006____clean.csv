Out of order execution, register renaming and speculative execution are very hard to wrap your head around.<p>That's what I liked about the 6502 - very simple, very direct and somewhat RISC-ish. Not many ways to do something. It is said the ARM was very 6502 influenced, but I never worked with it on a low level.<p>The other thing I liked about the 6502 was that I was flying under the OS all the time on those machines.

1352292,story,,,74,35,phugoid,Ask HN: Do you recognize this approach to programming?,,"A few of the flight simulators I work with use a novel software framework developed inhouse by the manufacturer.  I'm curious if any of you can\nidentify something similar.<p>The convential approach for commercial flight simulators is to use a large shared memory to hold the state of the simulation, and a game loop.  Hardware interface signals are fed into that shared memory, and every iteration of the game loop executes software that reads and updates the shared memory.<p>The novel approach uses no shared memory.  When a hardware input signal changes, it raises an ""event"" consisting of a name and value.  The\nsoftware then raises any other events that depend on this one.  They have created a programming language to get the most from this.  In that language, say you have:<p>a = b + c<p>d = e + f<p>These two lines will NOT get executed in sequence.  They declare relationships between events.  When event ""b"" occurs, the event ""a"" will be raised and its value depends on b and also the last value of the c event.<p>It turns out this is really powerful and works well on a distributed system. Did they create something new here?",1274029046

As a ""researcher"" at UC Berkeley I was able to work on my own projects and engage in the nearby startup scene without problems.<p>Now that I need to find a legit job allowing me to stay in the U.S., I'm afraid that I will not be able to work on my own projects as much anymore. In Germany I used to work as a freelance consultant. Is it possible to get a Visa doing freelance work? Or part-time work?<p>Another question is what kind of Visa I can get? Apparently regular H1-B working Visas are handed out only in April, so I'm out of luck. Is it easier to get internship Visas?<p>The next-best thing to working on my own projects would be to work for an early stage startup (the earlier, the better).

Before there actually was a Lisp!<p>Near the end of <a href=""http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/node3.html#SECTION00030000000000000000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/node3.html#S...</a> we find:<p><i>Another way to show that LISP was neater than Turing machines was to write a universal LISP function and show that it is briefer and more comprehensible than the description of a universal Turing machine. This was the LISP function eval[e,a], which computes the value of a LISP expression e - the second argument a being a list of assignments of values to variables. (a  is needed to make the recursion work). Writing eval required inventing a notation representing LISP functions as LISP data, and such a notation was devised for the purposes of the paper with no thought that it would be used to express LISP programs in practice. Logical completeness required that the notation used to express functions used as functional arguments be extended to provide for recursive functions, and the LABEL notation was invented by Nathaniel Rochester for that purpose. D.M.R. Park pointed out that LABEL was logically unnecessary since the result could be achieved using only LAMBDA - by a construction analogous to Church's Y-operator, albeit in a more complicated way.</i><p><i>S.R. Russell noticed that eval could serve as an interpreter for LISP, promptly hand coded it, and we now had a programming language with an interpreter.</i><p><i>The unexpected appearance of an interpreter tended to freeze the form of the language, and some of the decisions made rather lightheartedly for the ``Recursive functions ...'' paper later proved unfortunate. These included the COND notation for conditional expressions which leads to an unnecessary depth of parentheses, and the use of the number zero to denote the empty list NIL and the truth value false. Besides encouraging pornographic programming, giving a special interpretation to the address 0 has caused difficulties in all subsequent implementations.</i>",1274028071

It's a fact.<p>Also, you've entirely missed the point of what I wrote:  if we do end up living in a world where skilled jobs die out before unskilled jobs, we're in trouble.  Hundreds of years of human societal progress have depended upon education and technological development.  When that trend goes the other way, our society is well on its way to decline.<p>When I look over the comments in this thread, I can't help but noticed that 90% of them can be summarized as <i>""I knew some stupid kids in college who did things I think are useless;  I knew some kids who didn't go to college and succeeded; therefore, college is useless.""</i>  It's a logical fallacy, writ large.

If you want to have a named corporation you need to do a NUANS search first. As far as I'm aware, the cheapest NUANS searches are from here:<p><a href=""http://www.corporationcentre.ca/docen/pns/home.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corporationcentre.ca/docen/pns/home.asp</a><p>No affiliation, just a satisfied customer. Note that even if it finds a 'hit', it doesn't mean that your choice of name will be disallowed.<p>Online incorporation is cheaper than filling out paper forms, and the online wizard includes a bunch of boilerplate options that make life super-simple. If you live in certain jurisdictions, the wizard will even do the provincial registration for you.<p>As for collecting payments, this is a ""problem"". If you have good credit, you may be able to use Beanstream to provide merchant services (they provide merchant accounts through TD). If you don't have good credit, then PayPal is probably the option to go for. Depending on what you're doing, this may or may not be a positioning issue. If you're doing merchant stuff, you <i>definitely</i> want to have some kind of corporation in place. BTW Beanstream is one of the few Canadian merchant service providers supported by ActiveMerchant (if you're doing the Rails thing).<p>I have no experience with Moneris. My experience with Global Payments is that you can't just talk to a person - they have a (probably commission-based) outside salesforce. If you don't have an existing business, they want to see personal asset and liability information. All seems far too annoying.<p>Finally, regarding data security: if you do <i>anything</i> with credit cards, outsource that liability by using tokenization or PayPal. You don't want to have to deal with PCI compliance directly. I recently completed a project for a very large electricity retailer who needed to get to PCI compliance and took the outsource option, so it's not like that's just a choice for ""the little guys"".<p>Yes, you'll probably want to collect GST or HST, and remitting that back to the government is pretty simple; make sure you don't spend ""their"" money! The mechanics are: take customers' money, keep track of the amount that belongs to the CRA, give them that money according to a schedule you must meet. As a startup, you can remit GST annually (the mandated minimum frequency is based on your sales, if you expect to have very low sales, you can choose annual - but you can even file monthly if you like paperwork).<p>Hope that helps a bit!",1274026959

Try and look at it more from the customer's point of view; they are basically signing up to be spammed, correct? A small business may want all those features you listed (remember that features don't sell, benefits do), but they aren't going to buy if you don't show how customers will also benefit and opt-in in droves.  SMS is simple for a lot of people to use, but it might be helpful to explain how people actually opt-in.<p>The website is too word heavy; try asking a few friends to read a paragraph you have written, then summarize it back to you. Usually you'll get a more concise answer that could be used instead.<p>Like everybody else, I recommend you re-evaluate your pricing. The mailchimp example somebody mentioned is perfect. The paragraph you have between Indicative Pricing and Pricing is completely unnecessary.<p>The How It Works page also needs to be pared down. The goal should be to get small businesses to sign up, then have it be so simple to use that the operation acts as a guide.

RAM is so cheap nowadays, we just tend to stuff two memcached machines with 64G, which goes a ridiculously long way.<p>On the other hand, as antirez pointed out, redis shines when you need ""a little more than caching"". We have rolled a few custom queueing solutions on top of redis (similar to resque) and working with lists and the SUBSTR operation is an extremely pleasant experience.<p>Redis seems to be the optimal ""roll-your-own-queue"" toolkit at this point. We had some strong delivery- and persistence-guarantee requirements in our project but those were not a problem to meet with a simple WAL on the clients and a redis-pair. So far our solution wins over the previous rabbitmq setup big time in all areas (performance, reliability, complexity, transparency). It could have been done with memcached, but less efficiently due to the lack of the aforementioned list-operations.",1274026622

Consider this:  Do Active-X controls run on the iPhone (or Android)?  No -- they never have, and this is for technical AND business reasons.  It would be fairly easy to support them -- just have WINE as part of OS X.  The reason Apple doesn't do this is because they would be letting the fox into the henhouse and adding unnecessary bloat to a mobile device.  Everyone seems to get this, which is why you don't hear complaints from all of the Java and Silverlight people about not being able to code for iPhones.<p>To another point:  Ask yourselves -- What is Adobe's business model?  They make NO money on the Flash plugin.  It's free.  They make their money on tools.  If I'm the Adobe CEO, I would strive to have every app in the world written in Flash.  Now who is close-minded?  And by the way, Adobe could solve this VERY easily by making their tools output in HTML5, etc.  Why don't they want to do this?  Because they feel that HTML5 might be slow to adopt features that they already have.  Oh wait -- now the shoe is on the other foot!  Adobe realizes that the innovation of their platform would be stifled by any lack of features in HTML5.  So why don't they have their tools output Objective-C code which could then be compiled by Apple's tools?  My understanding of section 3.3.1 is that this is allowed.<p>Developer tools are the gateway to a platform.  Microsoft knows this -- which is why they have some of the most mature tools around.  When Microsoft adds a feature to their operating system, why do you as developers feel comfortable waiting for Flash, Java, etc to create an interface to that new feature?  If I were a software company, I would embrace a platform and strive to be the best on it -- use every new feature to its fullest extent.  Guys, this is what you get paid to do -- innovate, using whatever tools are necessary!  It's about the end user experience.  This is what makes an app sell.<p>So what Steve is gambling on, and it's a bold yet well-considered move, is that the iPhone/iPad/iPod platform (hardware + OS) will always be slightly ahead of competitors.  And the developers who agree will retrain themselves to take advantage of the platform.  Development tool vendors will do the same.  If Apple were to release a killer hardware feature on the iPhone (which is their business model to do so!), how long would it take for Flash to incorporate it into not only their player but also their development tools?  Would they wait until Android implemented it too before doing the release?  This harms Apple, it harms developers, and it harms consumers.<p>Flash has a cross-platform, least-common-denominator approach to computing.  This is a thing of the past!<p>You might be saying to yourselves that Microsoft never blocked anything -- Flash, Java, RealPlayer, etc.  Well, they have a different business model.  They want people to consider Windows as the defacto OS platform, and they want to support an ecosystem of ISVs that fill in all the gaps.  It's a very well-conceived plan, and it only works because they have a near monopoly on the desktop.  If they did not, then their business model would not work.  Imagine if you will a world where Linux itself was not free AND they charged for the development tools AND those were the only tools you can use to develop for the platform (as is DevStudio).  As you can see, Linux's lack of market share would make this an untenable business model.<p>Why do you think they charge money for their development tools?  Eclipse, XCode, and dozens of others are free of charge (yes, I know there is a free version of DevStudio but it is missing some key features).  They charge money because they CAN.  Adobe charges money because they CAN.  If Apple were to charge money for XCode, it would kill the platform.  Think about this anytime you are bashing Apple for the high perceived cost of their computers relative to humdrum PCs -- you're getting software that was developed by companies that got the tools for free, and this means you will get better software.<p>Flash developers, you are right to be up in arms over the omission of Flash as part of the iPhone OS.  But you're directing your anger at the wrong party.  First, I understand that you are loathe to have to learn a new toolset (which you feel is inferior to Flash) to get your apps out there.  Years of experience that you have will help to bridge that gap!  You are good developers and you will find a way.  You should instead be asking yourselves, why are there no 3rd-party Flash development tools that compare to Adobe's?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#Third-party_tools"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#Third-party_tools</a><p>Why is the .SWF format not entirely open?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.swf#Licensing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.swf#Licensing</a><p>Adobe has great tools that create compelling apps -- there's no denying that.<p>Microsoft has great tools that create compelling apps -- there's no deny that.<p>And Apple has great tools too.  Closed systems are a thing of the past (remember when Microsoft had ""hidden"" APIs that their apps used?).  By being forced to expose the hidden APIs, it removed the need for cross-platform emulation/library layers.  Yes, it's more work for you, but c'mon, you're good developers, the best at what you do.
