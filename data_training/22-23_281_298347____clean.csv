145126,comment,144984.0,145116.0,0,0,qaexl,,,"That might not be a great idea, not because of the violence involved, but because that twists the training. If the kid lucks out, he'd find a training group willing to work out whatever it is that is attracting bullies to him. If he doesn't luck out, he ends up being the guy getting beaten up in the dojo.<p>I actually know of a guy who didn't luck out. His father forced the guy to go learn karate as a kid. Because he was getting picked on. His father yelled at him when he sucked. I imagine his teachers then yelled at him too. The worst part of it was that after he grew up, he is <i>still</i> taking some form of martial arts. He is <i>still</i> getting picked on by his training group, even though he switched to a different art, twice. He is so desperate for friends, he whines about the verbal abuse of his current teacher yet refuses to quit because the training group and the teacher are the only friends he has. These are not the reasons to go learn a martial art.<p>That's not to say Karate won't work. The main thing is to get him around people who act like <i>sane</i>, socially-healthy adults -- people who takes initiative in a civilized society yet have not lost touch with their survival instincts. That may or may not be karate.",1206399511
145125,comment,144808.0,144808.0,0,0,Spyckie,,,"I think we need to look at the landscape of the startup community. If you didn't have to grow to survive, then it would be fair to say that the goal is to create opportunities for people to 'live as they should'. However, the fact is that it is hard to stay afloat if you don't grow. Growth, as defined by how big your company gets and how much market share it has, is also an indication of how long the company will last. Ideally, the bigger your company is, the more it can do, and the more market share your company has, the less your competitors have. This means that you need to grow in order to survive - otherwise your competitors will take the market share from you and leave you without a business.<p>If you manage your successful company like a startup all of its life, then you'll hit failure sooner because startups just have a higher chance of failure because of their risk taking nature. Corporate structure just carries along a lower inherent risk.",1206399505

Seaports, navigable rivers, stable, friendly neighbors, political stability, and arable land are all forms of wealth.  Just because they aren't owned by an individual doesn't mean they aren't wealth.  Most people in Africa lack these things and therefore they are poor.  If these things existed, then there would be an infrastructure that would let individual, hard working and industrious Africans become wealthier.<p>If you compare any rich country with any poor country, you can make a similar list of things the poor country is lacking that make it poor.

But throw him in a new neighborhood where nobody knows his past at all, and I'll bet you the same problem will occur. That's because he's projecting a bloody image of himself that the sharks will no doubt sniff real quick. ""<p>I've only been rarely picked on as a kid, maybe all of five times that I remember. No one tried more than twice. I made friend with some of them. I pushed around a couple people (psychologically and socially), at least until one of them told me a few years later exactly what I did. (We were walking somewhere, and he opened up to me for some reason).<p>I agree that there are aggressors that sniff out fear and weakness. This may even be a literal thing, if someone can smell the stink of fear. However, I have no idea if this is what's happening in this specific instance of Billy. You really have to be face-to-face before you can be sure.<p>Whether or not Billy is giving off the ""I'm a victim"" signal, counting on the authorities is like looking for a bigger bully. You're reaching for a bigger stick, whether that is in the form of a lawsuit or jail time.<p>On the flip side of things, the American public education system  is not that great. It's biggest flaw, particularly in middle school, is that it sets up the same kind of conditions as found in the Stanford Prison experiment. But that is more of a comment about the teacher-student dynamic than it is about the student-student dynamic. When you come down to it, forcing kids to go to school turns the whole education process into one big babysitting operation, and I think most kids know this at some level. Does that create more opportunities for these kids to get a sick kick?<p>I have a couple friends that grew up in the Talladega, AL area. Each of them independently told me that people around there are clinically antisocial and borderline-psychopathic. Hell, some are not even ""borderline"". They each told me that it wasn't just that people are inheriting genetic factors that predispose them to these kind of behavior, there are also environmental factors reinforcing them. The parents there mess with their kids. A common form of entertainment for groups of men is walking around looking for someone to beat up. In other words, you don't walk around in that area unless you're prepared to be physically assaulted.<p>A number of these issues is thoroughly addressed in Orson Scott Card's book, Ender's Game. Or even Lord of the Flies. Adolescent humor is exactly that. ""Heh-heh"". Look at Beavis and Butthead or South Park. It's what happens when there's no longer any real coming-of-age rites in a civilized society.",1206398309

Fortunately it was ""only"" words in my case but the ravages and dynamics are mostly the same, I think. Here are some couple points, in random order:<p>- Probably, about 50% of the fault lies with Billy. He will <i>never</i> get out of this hell if he doesn't accept a big part of responsibility. There's a reason he's the only one that gets beat so much and so hard. I'm sure his mother is well-meaning, but she's not helping him by putting all the blame on the other kids and the authorities which don't do squat. Which brings me to my next point.<p>- Trying to get Billy out of hell by counting on authorities or throwing lawsuits is mostly pointless. The perpetrators are mostly untouchable and they're fully aware of it. Those that push for the authorities to enforce Billy's safety are only taking his destiny out of his hands and giving him a good excuse to blame others for his predicament. ""It's not my fault if I'm not safe, it's the authorities that don't protect me enough"". There will always be waves and waves of people that will attack Billy, verbally or physically, because guess what, there are tons of people in this world that are in dire need of better status and self-esteem and a lot of them will opt to pray on easy targets to make themselves feel superior.<p>- I'm sure Billy thinks he can't reverse the tide because everyone knows him and how he gets beat. But throw him in a new neighborhood where nobody knows his past at all, and I'll bet you the same problem will occur. That's because he's projecting a bloody image of himself that the sharks will no doubt sniff real quick. When I was bullied, when people I had never even seen called me names I thought the word somehow had got around. But what I should have understood is that it's just the blood and shark thing. It's not that everyone knows you, it's that everyone can picture you in the generic loser template. Those days, I can recognize the ""old me's"" at a glance, and it's painfully obvious I could become a bully if I hadn't matured properly.<p>- Trying to find external motivations like ""he's too tall"" or ""he wears glasses"" or ""he has learning disabilities"" is BS. When I was a loser, I was indeed ""too tall"", and there always was ""something wrong with me"" (ex: unfashionable clothes), but now I'm as tall as ever and I still have unfashionable clothes but nobody notices that anymore.

Human brains understand everything (including code) via embodied metaphors and deal with complexity by splitting it into modules, then understanding each module abstractly, pushing away the details. Evolution doesn't work that way, at all. Why would it?",1206396580
