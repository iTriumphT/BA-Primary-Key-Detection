Also, &quot;Expander&quot; sounds like a preview of the SOR3soundtrack.<p>In SOR3 Koshiro worked with a partner, and developed a system that uses procedurally generated samples. It sounds a bit more harsh, with some break beats and bit more noisy. While not so pleasing to the ear sometimes, it is features some really interesting composition. I recommend &quot;Fuze&quot;, &quot;Cycle I&quot;, &quot;Inga Rasen&quot; and the stressful &quot;Bulldozer&quot;.<p>Also by Yuzo Koshiro, check out out Revenge of the Shinobi.

It&#x27;s relative. The seek to read ratio of RAM is very roughly comparable to that of SSD and to that of HDD. It&#x27;s just that SSD is faster than HDD and RAM is way faster than SSD.<p>You may need to tweak a few numbers, such as how aggressive the read-ahead is, and how big the buffers are, but none of this necessitates a new file system or a brand new way of seeing things.<p>&quot;They&#x27;re different so they need different file systems&quot; is honestly a bit of magical thinking, hoping for discovering untapped potential, just because of some fuzzy feeling of novelty SSD invokes.<p>What would <i>you</i> change specifically in a file system optimized for SSD?

Hardware designs would still be covered by copyright law, so a competitor would still have to reimplement it from scratch. Which is actually <i>more</i> work than doing so for software because hardware languages use a lower level of abstraction, and the design needs to be tested much more thoroughly because you can&#x27;t fix bugs post-hoc. Also, giant SoCs present a natural barrier to entry to new companies because a new company needs to have all the blocks, not just one or two. There may be a dozen companies  trying to make LTE basebands today, but that situation is unsustainable and we are already seeing exits. In short: ASIC innovation would be profitable even without patents.\nAlso, we seem the same kind of behavior in the hw sector: Qualcomm was found to be abusing its patents: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Inc._v._Broadcom_Corp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Inc._v._Broadcom_Corp</a>.",1403256124

Sometimes the writing is a little rough ... don&#x27;t let that fool you.<p>Ultimately, I think he&#x27;s right: what we need is to be able to invent and use high-level languages and DSL&#x27;s that are wonderfully expressive for our domain (with fast iteration and all that), but also to be able to control the low-level run-time code that gets executed as a result, so it can be fast and efficient.<p>That&#x27;s the holy grail as I see it. And LLVM is a key contender to provide the backend of that vision. (TFA talks about a lot of other things, but this is pretty much how I interpreted its conclusion, and I agree).",1403255742

Both are supported by both major chip vendors (Xilinx and Altera). Although neither vendor supports anywhere near the latest versions of either of these languages which is frustrating.<p>It may sound crazy, but I prefer VHDL because it is more verbose. The benefit of the verbosity is precision. with VHDL, you must specify exactly what you want, the syntax doesn&#x27;t allow for ambiguity. With Verilog, you can let the &quot;compiler&quot; infer some things for you, but you need to think really hard if it will infer the right thing for you. The benefit is that you get to type fewer characters. Since I do not pay (or get paid) per character typed, it is far more important to me to type a little bit more, and get exactly the design I want. When designing circuits, one thing you cannot afford to be is lazy. It is all about precision, because if you get it wrong, there is no step through debugger to help you, and often, it will still work in simulation, but fail to work in real hardware, which means you&#x27;re stuck.<p>I can&#x27;t say for certain with the latest version of the textbook, but IIRC, the version I had many years ago was specifically tied to the DE2. There were a range of exercises to go through with specific problem statements etc. IMHO, the DE1 is equivalent enough that you can change a few pin mappings and get the same result. I cannot say anything about the DE0.",1403255029

I think that the author thinks OOP means ObjectListenerBuilderProviderFactoryAdpterImpls and repeated use of words defined by Gamma et al.

These are not a fad, they are necessary components of all large-scale software.<p>The Linux kernel, which is entirely written in C, is a fine example of object-oriented programming. File descriptors are object references. The filesystem is a beautiful heirarchy of polymorphic nodes.
