It's academically selective (slightly under 20% acceptance rate), and yes, very pricey for those not on financial aid.  The demographics did skew toward children of upper-middle-class parents who wanted degrees in useless subjects.  Liberal arts, after all.<p>BTW, this is not saying that 50% of graduates could not find jobs.  There were a couple in that situation (mostly English, history, and language majors), but most people living back with their parents had jobs - in some cases, very good ones.  I worked at a financial software startup.  I had a classmate at the State Dept.  Another friend was doing strategic analysis at MITRE (MIT Research and Engineering).  All of us chose to live with our parents, even though we were making more than the median <i>household</i> incomes for our respective areas.  Then there are more conventional live-with-parents stories, like the schoolteachers and librarians and baristas and unemployed.<p>It's more that if a large enough critical mass (say, all the English majors) chooses to live with their parents, it then becomes socially acceptable.  And then their friends do it (while banking the rest of their salary), partially so as not to feel ""different"" from their less-successful classmates and partially just because they can.",1238132621

He's a bright guy so I would imagine he can figure out a way to make the employees feel comfortable enough to be dead honest with him. While you are right that there will be some cleansing, in general the employees can show him what they are talking about in a way that some feedback form just couldn't accomplish. (I must note that even dishing out a feedback form to employees once or twice a year is a giant step for many companies.)",1238132558

To get advice like yours, which I followed in addition to sending emails to their main site.<p>2. This is a somewhat interesting issue in that more and more sites simply pass every request to their script engine and then process the URI to determine what to do with it.  This seems to be true on HN also as you get a response to every request.<p>If you go to <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/test.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/test.gif</a> this is being processed by the back end most likely.  Now multiply this by 10 or 20 such requests for every 1 real page load from one of these misconfigured systems. \nThis of course wastes a bunch of resources.  In the least it may start sessions that don't need to be started, at the most, even db connections are made before module information is determined and the request can be rejected.<p>This is not just some single person on the net with a misconfigured cache/proxy but an ISP.  This potentially means that all users using their ISP are causing much more load on sites than they need to be.<p>Is this trivial?  It may seem so.  In the old days this was a non issue.  The server did not have that file and minimum resources were used to send a 404 response. Today, it's probably less likely, as your web app may be launching bootstrapping code, starting sessions, db connection, just to determine that this is a bad request.<p>3. It's a warning for all us developers, that misconfigured systems like this do exist out there and you can take measures in designing your site to handle these with minimum resources.",1238131970

One thing that seemed a bit off to me was inconsistent capitalization: ""missionary"" is sometimes capitalized and sometimes not (I would suggest that it not be capitalized) and the sentence at the top (Share your Missionary's Photos, Experiences and More with your Friends and Family!) seems like it it's too long to have most of the words capitalized. I think it'd be easier to read in all lowercase.<p>I agree with patio11 on the lightbox effect, but I still think it needs some sort of tour or demo instead of just screenshots.

Just because you're not living in government housing or collecting any welfare doesn't necessarily mean you're using fewer tax dollars.<p>The US military industrial complex, the largest socialist institution in the world, exists in part to protect the wealth of this nation.  If the US was a much poorer nation, we would have significantly less need for a large military (nor could we afford it).  If you're wealthy, you're probably just as reliant on roads and airports, perhaps even more so than a poor person who probably walks/bikes more often. The wealthy are also completely dependent on affordable, readily available education (K-12 and higher education) to train the workforce.  Then there's all the wealth created in the private sector that have been reaped from research originally conducted by NASA, the NIH, and for the military.  And lets not get started on corporate welfare which props up everyone's investments in the domestic equities markets.<p>Most of what I've listed is an indirect benefit, but lets not pretend that the wealthy have decoupled themselves from the spendings of the US Government.  Spending is rarely cut  for just this reason: the big money backing the politicians doesn't want its share of the government cheese to disappear.  It's no accident true small government proponents are marginalized and replaced with phony doppelgangers spewing platitudes about ""small government"" only to turn around and feed the very beast they've been elected to destroy.",1238130631

It's nice to see a CEO who is keen to experience his business from every angle.<p>From observing the workplace of my girlfriend, who has recently worked in retail for a large, national corporation, I can tell that the particular company she works for definitely doesn't.  Very often they get instructions about how to rearrange the sales floor that anyone actually working there with the customers would never in a million years think was a good idea -- usually, a few weeks later, they're told to change back to what they were doing. My guess is that's how it goes in most big companies.  Eventually, the suits don't touch the nitty gritty parts of the business, and they end up getting way out of touch.<p>That said, I doubt if Bezos, by virtue of the fact that everyone will know who he is, will run into the rumored ""sweatshop"" conditions at some Amazon distro centers (if those rumors are at all true, which is impossible for anyone who hasn't worked in one to say): <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10123835-93.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10123835-93.html</a><p>EDIT: Also, does Jeff Bezos have a blog?

For the scope that the press intended, the stats they reported were accurate.<p>To reiterate (and not to clarify, because my original comment is clear): When the press reports rises and declines, if they do not explicitly say year over year, they are talking month over month. Indeed, this VERY article contains an example of it, with the press reporting that home sales were up 4.7%. The original title of this submission, before it was edited to include ""year over year"", specifically played upon this implied and incorrect comparison to provoke a response.<p>Indeed, I'm not the only one who found the headline misleading; my comment had been voted up to at least 5 shortly after I posted, and before the headline was altered and your tangential comment sent people on a wild goose chase.",1238130262
