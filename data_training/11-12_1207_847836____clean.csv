It's all about allocating the benefits from current production.<p>Social security schemes and government-guaranteed pensions mean that the government (=the voters) decides how much each currently productive worker has to give away, and how much each retiree gets.<p>Private retirement funds mean that for each retiree, the amount of money earned from their own former productivity which they relinquished into their retirements fund AND the amount of money they acquired otherwise and put there AND the management of the fund AND other economical factors influencing it decide how much that retiree is allowed to take away from those currently productive.<p>Finally, the millenia-old ""retirement plan=loving children"" means that how much each retiree gets depends on how many children they were able to have, how many of those survived, how productive they are, and how much they're willing to give up according to their character, how much they love their parents or how much social pressure towards supporting your parents there is.",1281700630

While both are bytecode interpreters you need to translate Java bytecodes into Dalvik ones to use the former.  I'll need to read more (just woke up) to see just what Oracle is objecting to.<p>Bytecode based systems are an old old old concept due to the severe lack of memory available in the bad old days, e.g. I personally know that as of the mid-late '70s the Lisp Machine's compiler went to a bytecode that the microcode would then interpret.  As I recall Smalltalk did this and I know it wasn't a new concept.  Heck, what about UCSD's Pascal system?<p>Don't know the history of JIT compilation, let alone various tricks that have recently been developed; Java is the second <i>wildly</i> successful bytecode system, I think, after UCSD's, which was done back when memory was a lot more precious.<p>And Dalvik optimized for among other things low memory demand, e.g. it is register based and Java bytecode is stack based.<p>Thanks for pointing this out.",1281700324

It gets more difficult as you have dependants, but some things will work, some things wont, and overall you just kind of hope it works out in the long run. There are no guarantees, but I don't know many people who pursue that life and end up on the street.<p>I wouldn't say I live a truly cutting edge entrepreneurial life but in 20 years of ""adulthood"" I have never had a ""real job"", I've gotten married, two kids, nice house in a leafy part of London.

I bought one out of curiosity and played with it for a couple of days. But while I'd have <i>killed</i> for one  during my university days, today I just reach for a keyboard. To get the most out of it, you need to carry around: (a) the Livescribe pen, (b) at least one notepad, and (c) the earbuds/microphones. And you need (d) the docking/charge cradle and (e) a laptop to synch with at the end of the day. If you need pen-based on-the-go note taking, why not buy a second hand Palm TX, or an HP iPaq 210? And if you don't like writing by hand, why are you bothering?<p>The killer use case for it is where you need to record an audio track synched to your handwriting.

NetApp already flexed muscles and made clear they'll go after anyone daring using OpenSolaris and most probably anything sporting ZFS (including *BSD), in a storage oriented product. Frankly, I don't see any reason to use OpenSolaris if not for ZFS.<p>IMHO OpenSolaris won't represent much more than NetBSD pretty soon.",1281697891

There is no moral difference between the mugger's threat to shoot you for not forking over and the government's threat to take your property or throw you in jail for not forking over.  And the recipient/beneficiary of the theft is a thief, even if you/they are too gutless to do your/their own threatening.  Maybe you are one of those idiots who actually believes in the ""Social Security Trust Fund"" and you get your own money back; but that belief does not make it true.",1281697875

Instead of thinking of a succession of two dimensional grey-scale images, I said - let's consider the 4D space where the dimensions are X, Y, intensity and frame time, and then think of the images as a mapping from that 4D space into {0,1}.<p>Now generalise into a mapping from C^2 -> [0,1] and think about continuity.  Various properties of objects moving in your images translate nicely into properties of the functions.  The thing we were trying to do turned out not to be posible, but this way of thinking showed us a similar idea that worked, and the solutions provided could be warped into a solution of the original problem.<p>Interestingly, in a sense it was like proving that a given problem is NP-Complete in that we converted the problem we had into another, then converted the solutions back.<p>It's the rich inter-connectedness that gives you this, not the individual fields.  People recommend that you learn Linear Algebra, or Complex Analysis, or Group Theory, or Topology, but in truth, no single field helps on its own.<p>They are intertwingled, and it's the connections that carry the real benefits.",1281697517
