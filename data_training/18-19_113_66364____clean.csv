This ""hack"" is kind of obvious, and whomever implemented the system should have thought of it. The only remotely criminal thing I can see in this is using an automated script to move his money.<p>The way I read the post, he deposited all his money ($50,000 or so?) into the account, withdrawing it again as soon as he was credited. He could have refreshed the page himself, hired a Chinese monkey to do it or create a script to log in and deposit money again and again...call me a genius, but I can't see how this is a very sophisticated or even defraud an obviously broken system.",1201460337

I think Russ's point was that if minimum wage actually was raised high enough by the well-meaners that they thought it would institute social change, it would backfire in a most comical and epic way. Imagine if the minimum wage were set to 100/hour tomorrow...<p>Instead, politicians just wait till election season then realign the letter of the law to more or less match the current market value and then proclaim what a friend to the poor they've been from the doorway of their gulfstream.",1201460032

To a lot of people, that's no comfort, as a cognitive aristocracy is no better than a financial aristocracy. The strategy at the ivies has been to filter for both the very smart and the very rich. This gives <i>aptitude</i> access to <i>capital</i>.<p>If this article was about a high-end public school that got its budget from seized money (eg property taxes), then rest assured that the private-school-educated NYTs editors would have suggested some forceful ""fixes"" for the ""problem"".",1201460009

He would deposit so much money at a time (up to $50K) that he got bored clicking buttons, so he wrote a script to do it for him.<p>So, if depositing money wasn't against the rules and withdrawing the money after he got the FPPs wasn't against the rules, how can you possible claim that ""this was a crime""?",1201459850

SV isn't particularly worth seeing as a tourist (it is basically a cultural wasteland, although Stanford is a nice campus and of course SF is a great city).

105060,comment,104977.0,104977.0,0,0,andrewf,,,"If you often bang keys for 20 seconds, then sit still thinking for 40 seconds, try adjusting that split to 30+30. You're typing slower but you're not working slower.<p>Variety works well for me. I had a bad pain that was triggered by depressing the left mouse button. I now alternate my mouse between hands on a roughly weekly basis. After the first few days mousing left handed, it was no longer slowing me down.<p>Also, I find alternating seat height, keyboard type and position, screen height, etc eases the general back and neck pains that can come with sitting in the same position for too long. Whether 3+3+3+3 hours in varied positions is better than 12 hours in the same, ""optimal"" position is probably something physiotherapists would never agree on.<p>On medication: you don't want to use painkillers to enable your pushing too hard. On the other hand, my understanding is that inflammation is a bit of a vicious circle (inflamed tissues are more easily further irritated), so anti-inflammatories are your friends. Topical medication may be more or less effective than pills, and are less likely to screw up your stomach.",1201459540

If they were extravagant wastes of money, they would be irrelevant.<p>The reason we have public education is that we're trying to give everyone an equal footing to start out in life.

105055,comment,105034.0,105034.0,0,0,JayNeely,,,"I graduated from a private high school in 2004, The McCallie School, in Chattanooga, TN. I was able to go because I had attended the academic camp(I know, I know. But hey, my mother wanted to keep me busy, and it was better than Bible camp) they hosted over the summer; from spending that time with them, they apparently were interested enough to offer my mom a financial aid deal for me to attend high school there.<p>Before McCallie, I had always gone to public school in a tiny Georgia town(Hiawassee), so switching to McCallie was a big deal, and a big change. There were definitely some of the things the NYTimes article describes: lots of money went toward athletics and athletic facilities(the US women Olympics crew team trained there), there were children from families of the ridiculously wealthy(most of whom were very nice, polite, and never snobbish), and by the time I was graduating there was a huge new dining hall/conference facility that had been finished, and plans for a state-of-the-art dorm building underway.<p>But I don't think McCallie misspent their money on those things, at least not in relation to how they spent on other things. Athletics never over-shadowed academics. Most of the teachers I had at McCallie were better than most I've had in college, and I don't know of any public school where I would have been able to receive 5 semesters worth of credit for English classes my senior year. McCallie had a great music program, and didn't skimp on funding for art classes either.<p>While I was a student, I never thought about the size of McCallie's endowment or how it was used, possibly because I never saw any indication it was being misspent. Now, Wikipedia tells me McCallie's endowment is ~$60 million, and that 85.7% of their expenditures in 2007 went toward program expenses. That sounds pretty good to me.<p>More importantly, the stats on McCallie's own site confirm what I saw among the student body: <a href=""http://mccallie.org/Internet/Default.aspx?pid=336"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mccallie.org/Internet/Default.aspx?pid=336</a>\nAlmost 20% of students receive financial aid, and there are 55 students receiving merit scholarships this year. At a school where the total enrollment is just over 900, that's a lot of kids who would find their abilities wasted in public schools being given great opportunities.<p>Sure, ""never let schooling get in the way of your education,"" and other Mark Twain wisdom. But not all prep schools are just comfy surroundings and a well-known name for rich kids to pad their college applications with. Some of them are really great tools that give, and encourage seeking out, a great education.",1201457848
105054,comment,104802.0,104802.0,0,0,mooneater,,,"I volunteered with my (then-) future wife to help build a big community playground.<p>At one point there were maybe 5 of use moving this tube slide into place.  It was a very big, heavy, very twisty-shaped tubed.  And we could feel it starting to slip.<p>We were all struggling to hold it up.  It wasnt working, and there was noone else nearby to help.<p>Suddenly I leaped up and grabbed a hold onto an edge at the top.  As I leaped I could hear and feel people being like ""wha..?"" because the shape was so strange, it was really hard to tell where the center of gravity was and how to adjust it.<p>But in that moment, all my physics and calculus classes merged with instinct like never before.  I was hanging from this very counterintuitive top edge with all my weight, and it stopped it slipping.  The group then had time to organize how to ease it - and me - down.<p>I am generally a non-athletic geek.  That morning I felt like a sports star.  The best part was, I needed no external validation for it.  My intellect was no longer relegated to the exam halls.",1201457839
