Either way, you're encouraging people to spam their friends -- not because they think their friends would be interested in this particular app, but in order to get some miniscule personal benefit ($500 divided by how many users?)<p>Personally, I'd be happy to see the ability to send invites turned off altogether. If any friend of mine really thinks I'll be interested in a particular app, they can damn well take the time to write me a message about it.",1201578295

Now the Patriot act is a touchy subject because the revisions Obama wants are much better than the ones Bush had. The war on drugs, imho, is a good thing. Just because he did drugs doesn't mean a damn thing. He knows first hand how bad they are. If anything that is better than someone fighting something they haven't experienced.",1201576706

105963,comment,105470.0,105470.0,0,0,Shooter,,,"You would think that just asking your potential users what they want is best, but then you have to worry about self-report errors.  As has been noted. (Customers lie. To you and themselves.  Accept it.)<p>I'm fairly stupid and I don't possess a crystal ball...but since I also don't want to waste my time on things that don't pan out financially, I've spent quite a bit thinking about this question.  I like to keep things simple, so I will generally only start or buy a company if it does one or more of the following (the more, the better):\n1.  Make the user money.\n2.  Save the user time.\n3.  Save the user money.\n4.  Get the user laid.\n5.  Save the user's life/improve their health.<p>There are a few other rules.  Numbers 2 and 4 should never exist only on their own.  Number 5 is often one of the most difficult to execute because prevention is harder to sell than solutions. And all of the potential ideas have to be a superior enough solution that they outweigh the switching costs for the customer (including the switching cost from nothing, inertia is a bitch!)  Number 2 is the most likely to suffer from the ""unwanted solution"" problem (for various reasons, an outlining of which I suppose would better address the original question.)  Multiple streams of income and multiple customer bases are always good things, just to hedge your bets.",1201575947
