Just being able to open every possible window in an app and then hit ""capture this to Photoshop"" when starting on a UI clean-up pass mockup, or for creating a master document of all windows when taking a desktop app from 1st pass programmer art to shipping resources, and sorting them into Photoshop layers and folders, would skip a lot of currently requisite document setup/prep time.<p>The suggestion to use this to more quickly build manuals and tutorials is also spot on.
