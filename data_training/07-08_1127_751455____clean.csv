It also prevents some of the cross-federated identity detection some ""services"" like RapLeaf try to do.<p>However, it becomes a pain with Gravatar, single sign on and places where email addresses have a provenance.<p>On that last point, I recently signed up for Qwiki, using the email address qwiki@mydomain.com. I also decided to sign up my girlfriend as well.  Long story short, she got an invite and I didn't. :(<p>If Qwiki used any social media tools to discover ""valuableness"" of a given user from their email address, hers would have had great provenance and mine would have nothing.",1288339192

Combine this with the IP address pool quickly getting smaller and smaller and you'll see that for smaller sites, it might be impossible to get the needed amount of addresses for a reasonable price.<p>For large sites, there's the problem of the various CDNs which are not always under the control of the site and might not be prepared for SSL.<p>Remember: All assets of an encrypted page must also be encrypted, otherwise the browsers display a nasty warning (even though unencrypted assets, when served from a different domain would not be a problem what's session hijacking is concerned).<p>""just use SSL"" might just not be possible in some cases.",1288338388

Often the spammers do sneaky things like return a spam page if you have a google.com referrer (e.g. if you click on search result on Google). Meanwhile, they might return a 404 if you enter the url directly in the address bar.<p>The first place I'd check is your .htaccess file--that's a common place where the hackers hide stuff. Also check for new/recently-added files in your directory. Some WordPress hackers will go so far as to inject malicious code straight into the WP database.<p>One tool you can use is a feature from google.com/webmasters called ""Fetch as Googlebot."" Once you prove that you own the site, you can tell Google to fetch your page and you'll see exactly what we see. This is a great way to tell if you've really cleaned out the hacks.<p>Another tool is our automatic url removal tool, also at google.com/webmasters . You can block a url in robots.txt and then use that tool to remove that page from Google's index.<p>If you've gotten everything, then the pages should start to leave Google's index after a few days.

I certainly like getting my salary from the bingo business regardless of whether the business sells a lot or a little in a given month!)<p>eBay currently extends them money far in advance of eBay receiving it, with the understanding that if there is an upside eBay will get most of it.  If eBay pays them only after eBay gets money, that will cause many of them to go cashflow negative, and since they are <i>not</i> billion dollar publicly listed companies with easy access to capital at low rates, that leads to the firm either failing or exiting the eBay relationship.  Neither of these outcomes benefit eBay.<p>There are numerous other risks this exposes affiliates to -- eBay retroactively changes the rules, eBay becomes unable to pay out the money, eBay has extrinsic changes in their business which lower payments after affiliates have incurred upfront costs sending them traffic, etc.  All of these risks make eBay a less attractive partner to do business with.<p>You can't always have everything you want.

Many cities do as well, but you're probably well aware of local options.<p>There's also Bard College at Simon's Rock which accepts rising high school juniors and gives them a BA in 4 years (and is affiliated with a top tier liberal arts college). The timing for that is just about right.<p>Also, you may be interested to learn more about the ""unschooling"" movement. Some variation of that might be a good fit for you. Google ""unschooling"" or ""John Taylor Gatto"" for some background info.<p>Other people in this thread have discussed the drawbacks of a GED rather an a high school diploma, so I thought I'd share this one little anecdote:<p>One of my classmates in high school happened to have skipped a lot more grades than most.  He was 12 in his junior year of high school, so I guess that made him 14 or 15 when he started college and around 19 when he graduated from undergrad.<p>He was a great kid. Clearly ridiculously smart but very modest and soft spoken. Everyone seem to like him. But he didn't really have  ""friends"" per se.  Everyone was nice to him, but everyone treated him like a kid brother.<p>I ran into him at our 15 year high school reunion and we had a long chat.  Looking back on it as a happy, successful and established adult, one thing he clearly regretted about his life is that he never really had a college or a high school ""experience"", he just went to classes.  And he regretted it.<p>My point is that there is more to the high school experience than what you're being taught in class. Sure, you can skip it, but be aware that you're trading away something with real value, sometimes even when it doesn't seem like it is.  I don't think that should make your decision for you, but it's another thing to throw on the ""no"" side of the scales.<p>Also, I think the deck is generally stacked against you as 15 year old high school drop out trying to succeed as an entrepreneur. Gaining a little bit more life experience (quite possibly doing fun and exciting things that aren't like high school) might make you a better entrepreneur.
