Im a business student and I took this spring semester off to launch a startup which wasnt very successful. I dropped that idea and tried to land an internship in the Bay Area this summer but I havent heard back from any of the three I applied to.<p>Im learning to program but I dont think I would be a good hacker intern because I dont think Im that good yet. Id be a much better business/marketing guy at a startup.<p>Im at a crossroads in my life and I could use some advice. I know this is Hacker News, but I think a lot of people in this community are much more intelligent than some of business communities I take part in.<p>I think Im facing two options:<p>1.) Move to the Bay Area and try to find a business dev/marketing job at a startup. If I cant Ill work anywhere to make ends meet while I try to launch a startup of my own. Ive been told the Bay Area is rich in entrepreneurship; upstate New York is probably the least entrepreneurial place in the country. I want to be around like minded people.<p>2.) My other option is to go back to school in the Fall. If I do this, Im going to have to work to get through it. My plan would be to take a real estate course this summer and then start working as a commercial real estate agent while Im at school. My biggest concerns with this are that I really dont have any interest in real estate, I would be doing it just for the money and between school and real estate I wouldnt have much time for a startup. And even if I have a successful stint in real estate I would never want to become complacent and make a career out of it, which basically just makes this a means to an end portion of my life.<p>Staying in school and doing real estate is a lot safer, but moving to the Bay Area would be a direct way to accomplish my goals. Do you have any advice?<p>Thank you for your time.",1304657734

This allows the article a pass since junior developers do need some level of guidance in how to work in a corporate environment, and think about which aspects of it they need to give more importance to (eg communication).<p>The thing is, after about 10-15 years of work, it seems like one doesnt want to play games like this anymore. Bottomline: Understand programming concepts in depth which allows one to learn new languages/paradigms quickly, and pretty much everything else melts away. Being a good corporate citizen ceases to hold much charm, and the focus shifts to doing good work on one's own terms. And in the process, the realization that communication is important (not just in a corporate setting) already happens and is ingrained.<p>So for that kind of a developer, this article wouldnt really help.

The reason why is that besides having a reliable manufacturing base, which after the Japan earthquake Apple understands the value of, Intel recently announced 3-D processors. These processors are likely to be at the state of the art for as long as the patents last. Apple has a precedent of going with the technology of the future, and 3-D chips are most likely going to be the future for a long while. Chips aside, Apple has made a major bet with Intel on Thunderbolt and it  would be illogical for Apple to ditch them without a VERY good reason.",1304657280

Besides reducing the bookkeeping, this approach has real advantages. Types can satisfy many interfaces at once, without the complexities of traditional multiple inheritance. Interfaces can be very lightweighthaving one or even zero methods in an interface can express useful concepts. Interfaces can be added after the fact if a new idea comes along or for testingwithout annotating the original types. Because there are no explicit relationships between types and interfaces, there is no type hierarchy to manage or discuss.",1304657010

There are probably other things incorrect in your comment but the main point I want to address is the ""equivalent to a pentium 3""; this is definitely not the case. Just because it is a dual core running at 1ghz doesn't mean it's slow. In fact most ARM machines are slower than their equivalent chips, but not as much as people would think. An example is the EfikaMX (Cortex A-8 @ 800MHz) runs only ~20% slower than an Atom clocked at 1.6GHz. But at a fraction of the power usage. My apartment is full of ARM machines and I have a build farm of ~20 that are compiling software (Ubuntu and Gentoo) 24/7 and my power bill was 40 dollars.  They also generate much less heat, and don't require fans, and most run off integrated SSD drives (PATA and SATA) so there are no moving parts at all in them. And... They are cheap. I can get a brand new ARM based netbook for 200 dollars that gives me ~ the equivalent processing of an Atom netbook of the same price... Except the Atom netbook is a refurb.<p>Cheaper, lower power consumption, and almost the same processing power. It works for me, sure I can't use proprietary software, or something like dropbox that requires a proprietary daemon, but I don't really miss it much.

At 10 minutes you're wasting 61 man hours (did I make a mistake? That seems way too large). Taking a low estimate on the value of people's time of about $10 per hour, you should be saving $610 to justify it...<p>Let's go with a smaller plane... My friend who is into airplanes tells me that 40 is a good estimate for shuttle planes from small cities to bigger hubs (30ish to 50ish, I just averaged them). So every 10 minutes you waste is about 6.5 man hours. Again valuing people's time at $10 per hour, you'd have to save $65 to break even (though that relies on pretty low valuation of the value of people's time).",1304654655
