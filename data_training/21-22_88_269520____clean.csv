I just sold mine a year ago and had no problems.<p>I bought a laptop and 3 months later got a work laptop negating my need for the other.  Sold it on ebay at a loss of just 50 bucks from the original price.  Yet another reason to buy a mac.  The resale value remains really high.,1210283570

185021,comment,184619.0,184838.0,0,0,kogir,,,"I chose Microsoft initially because it's what I knew best at the time, so it was the fastest way to get a working demo out the door.  Then I stuck with it because:<p>SQL Server 2005: The only other options were PostgreSQL and Oracle.  MySQL 5 had just come out and all the basic database features I intended to use (stored procedures, foreign key constraints, etc) were new, and thus untested.  Oracle cost a fortune (I think I was quoted $65k/core as my only licensing option). SQL Server was a natural choice.<p>ASP.Net: At the time the only other well tested equivalent was Java, and my brief examination of it led me to believe it was basically equivalent for my purposes.  It wasn't worth the switching cost.  Rails was really new and also required full access to the database, which I don't grant to our web servers.  PHP is extraordinarily difficult to keep clean when working in a team on a large project, so it wasn't really suitable (especially for the cell phone portion, which uses packed binary protocols).  Python web frameworks were still in their infancy, or I would have chosen it.<p>C#: It's fine for a statically type language. I like that it's similar to Java, but a little more relaxed (delegates, unsigned types, etc.).  I'm actually a horrible typist (20 WPM on a good day), so intellisense (increase speed) and compilation (find typos) were key.  The .NET framework is actually really good and rivals Java's.  MSDN docs are much more useful than JavaDocs in that they actually contain examples :)<p>Now, don't get me wrong.  We're not a 100% Microsoft shop.  We use Erlang (fault tolerant, distributed session state store), PHP (tile serving), Memcache, Apache (static content and PHP), PostgreSQL, Ubuntu and FreeBSD.<p>As for open versus closed source, not having access to the Microsoft source code has yet to be an issue.  We've had to work around things once or twice (usually because what we were doing wasn't in the spirit of the framework), but we've never encountered an actual bug, and Microsoft's products have always worked as documented thus far.  I'd rather not need source access than have to use it to get something working ;)<p>Ironically, the places where we've had problems are on the open source side.  PHP x86 != PHP x64 (same release version, different behavior) on some distributions (<i>cough</i> RHEL <i>cough</i>), and PostgreSQL on FreeBSD 6 is anything but straightforward (max connection limit problems).",1210283346

185013,comment,184982.0,184988.0,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"Essentially, the problem is a credentials issue. If you can distinguish ""serious"" buyers from the ""scammers,"" then you're set. I've done a little freelancing on elance.com, and the way they handle this problem is that they charge a small amount to make bids. Of course, this is somewhat different since one is bidding for jobs and not items (receiving money, not giving it), but it's still not very helpful, since I doubt anyone would pay even a nominal fee to make bids for <i>buying</i> items. Craiglist's solution to this problem is to limit buyers and sellers to their respective local geographic areas, which turns out to be pretty effective, but can oftentimes constrain market opportunities (and of course, there's no built-in auctioning capabilities).<p>I remember one post on YC a while back was about generating post modernism essays in response to spam emails to the point where a spammer could not possibly sift through all of them in a reasonable amount of time (and the ""English"" nature of the essays would make them hard to distinguish from real responses). This would make spamming unprofitable. Perhaps this can somehow be generalized to problems like s(c|p)ammers on eBay.",1210282615

185000,comment,184983.0,184983.0,0,0,andrewparker,,,"VCs analyze opportunities largely by pattern recognition.  They detect correlations between their past successes and then ride them for all they're worth when looking at new deals.  The ""no sex life"" thing is a particularly peculiar correlation that Doerr is focusing on, but his process of pattern recognition investing is pretty normal.<p>Important to note: these patterns and correlations, not causations, and no one is claiming them to be causations.  Doerr clearly does not think that ""nerdy, white, no sex life"" necessarily leads to ""billion dollar dot-com success"".  As Founders at Work (Jessica Livingston's book) very clearly outlines, successful founders look very different from each other and take very different paths to success.",1210281472
