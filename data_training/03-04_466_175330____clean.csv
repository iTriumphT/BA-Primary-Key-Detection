You can depend on modules freely and not worry about making it harder for users of your module to install it.</i><p>That statement is true in theory, as long as everyone follows semantic versioning and dependencies never have unexpected interactions because of bugs.<p>Unfortunately, in the real world, neither of these conditions holds perfectly. The moment you depend on any module in your package.json that directly or indirectly depends on any other module where any version is not precisely fixed, you are immediately running uncontrolled and probably untested (by you) code. Moreover, if anything does go wrong, you may also have considerable difficulty identifying and reproducing the exact combination of versions of everything that caused the failure.<p>I have spent far too many days over the past few months tracking down exactly these kinds of issues, sometimes in some of the best known and most popular modules available via npm. For example, as the article itself mentions, what you wind up with in your node_modules directory can depend on install order under the new scheme. I don&#x27;t think this is a good thing.<p>I therefore agree with those who advocate minimising dependencies, within reason of course. I also advocate strict version numbering and 100% reproducible builds, which is unfortunately quite hard to achieve once indirect dependencies start entering the picture with Node and npm, under either the old or the new scheme.",1451620405

Many of them are stuck doing hacky &quot;C with classes&quot; programming, much like they did from day one. The attitude is if it ain&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it.<p>I was one of those programmers. Then I picked up &quot;Effective C++&quot; by accident. It was a mind shift. I started coding differently after all these years. I got hooked and read every popular non beginner C++ book out there (I would guess around 50 of them).<p>So I think reading books, is a better way of learning to program than just blindly going your own way, or the blind leading the blind.",1451620355

If I run a search on Kayak (or similar) I can easily find the right combination of price and time that I need. But short of selecting a higher class it&#x27;s not clear which of the airlines will have wider seats or more legroom. There is no way to sort by these criteria.

For example, I&#x27;ll watch a pluralsight video, then challenge myself to see how far I can get from a blank directory to a working blogging app without getting stuck (too much). When I do get stuck, I&#x27;ll refer back and catch the minor details I might have missed trying to copy the code, etc.",1451617392
