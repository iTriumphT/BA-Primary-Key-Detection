It's obviously somewhere in between, on an aggregate level. Like between 30% and 70%.<p>""potential earnings"" does not mean ""value"".  You have no fundamental right to get paid; you need to convince people to pay you.  If you don't like it, don't provide your work in the first place.<p>Copyright deprives people of a non-zero percentage of the value of a work in the public domain; you claim people don't have the right to that value in the first place.  My ability to resell a used lamp deprives the lamp maker of the value they'd get by selling a new one; they still have no right to prevent me from doing so.",1322920719

I don't expect to get a pair of jeans for free because nobody offered me one.  If someone did, I expect Levi's to stay out of the deal, because it's none of their business.  And more generally, I don't expect to get offered a pair of jeans for free because nobody can manufacture them for free, and because I can't trivially copy a pair of jeans.  Given the availability of replicators in the future, I expect to get jeans and many other things for free.<p>Someone has bits and offers to provide a copy.  Someone else wants those bits and takes them up on the offer.  A copy occurs.

This is because you never know what you will find when you are digging. Example, how would you do auto plague pit detection? There is a fair amount of automation on sites already, piling rigs are semi-automatic and use relative GPS for setting out and various monitoring systems to control the speed of drilling and inflow of bentonite etc. Where automation will work best is when you have an easily defined problem.

3307677,comment,3303796.0,3305633.0,2,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> In the case of both real and intellectual ""property"", there is a resource from which limited value can be extracted. There are a limited number of cows that can graze in a given number of acres, there is a limited amount of money that can be made by selling a particular molecule as a drug, and there is a limited number of tickets that can be sold during opening weekend of a film.<p>Land has scarcity; not everyone can use it at once.  You've argued that the same thing applies to works currently controlled by copyright, but I (and many other people) fundamentally disagree.  Movie tickets have scarcity because not everyone fits in the theater at once; just look at the lines outside theaters on opening night of a popular film.  However, the film itself has no scarcity; that doesn't represent a moral statement, just a statement of reality.<p>That might mean that people making films have to find other ways to extract value, but as a culture that falls under ""not our problem"".  For a film people want to see, clearly the existence of the film has value, and people have found ways to make that support the film; just look at things like Kickstarter for one example, which would work just fine without copyright.  (They'll probably work far better once they become a necessity; right now they have to compete with the effectively subsidized development of works controlled by copyright.)<p>Also, the ability to interactively change our culture represents a <i>feature</i>, not a bug.  (Among <i>many</i> other things, see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_culture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_culture</a> .) We deal with media we find distasteful by giving a collective ""ewww"" and moving on.  That doesn't invalidate the huge value of having a rich public domain.  (And in the case of Disney and numerous others, note that most of their movies couldn't exist without a rich public domain for them to have drawn from.)<p>> So it seems to me that opposition to intellectual property can't come from ""legitimacy,"" unless we also consider ownership of real estate to be illegitimate. That would be a sad state of affairs, because I think the human race would be worse off without the idea of land deeds.<p>""Understatement"" doesn't quite cover the implications of not respecting the exclusivity of property.  But no, your premise doesn't hold; no natural scarcity exists for copyright and patents as presumed by the loaded phrase ""intellectual property"", the way it does for real estate.<p>Classic sci-fi thought experiment: if someone invented the replicator tomorrow, what else suddenly has no natural scarcity?  Real estate would rapidly become the <i>only</i> component of the physical world with scarcity; apart from that, only services would have value.<p>> Edit: RF spectrum is another example, I suppose -- there's a limited amount of value to extract (only so many channels), and there are conflicting uses that create different kinds of value (which applications to run on which frequencies with which propagation characteristics.) And the policy tradeoffs in spectrum ""property"" seem to be different again from those in real or intellectual property. For one thing, there's the rapid advance of technology, and the possibility of spread spectrum.<p>RF spectrum absolutely does have scarcity, albeit somewhat flexible scarcity since we continuously find new ways to pack more into less.  I don't think we currently handle spectrum regulation in the most efficient way (auctions don't necessarily seem like the right approach), but RF spectrum does at least have a legitimate claim as a limited resource that needs some kind of special handling.  That said, the value of special-purpose RF protocols has gone down significantly, compared to just finding ways to connect devices to the Internet.",1322918493

The reason for that being that this pie is growing, exponentially even. Competition may be fierce and you won't get rich over night, however the 700 million users that Facebook has will be nothing compared to the number of people carrying Androids in their pockets, 3 years from now. A lot of people have ridden the first wave, especially when it comes to Apple's App Store. However a bigger wave is coming and I don't want to invest the limited resources I have in Microsoft's me-too-me-too platform.<p>Another problem is one of trust - WinMo 7 is the successor of WinMo 6, but it's a completely different platform. This is understandable, as WinMo 6 simply sucked and in my view it was the same story as with IExplorer 6 - they got something working, then they reinvested resources in the latest fad du-jour, leaving customers and developers disappointed, WinMo 7 being their latest attempt at preventing irrelevancy. I have no trust left for Microsoft to do the right thing in regards to its developers or customers, fucking with their learned knowledge all over again, or leaving them in the dust.

The GIL is exactly the opposite: easy to reason about, but rarely will it save you. Consider.<p><pre><code>  x = cache['foo']\n  y = bar(x)\n  cache['foo'] = y\n</code></pre>\nHere a GIL will not help here: while lines 1 and 3 are atomic and the call to bar() may or may not be atomic, there is no guarantee that the whole set of operations is atomic.
