Sometimes the potential benefits of cooperation outweigh the risks.<p>It would really help if a big player made a commitment to OpenID, but I'm not sure that's the only way it could catch on. If tons of smaller players could come together on a wrap-type system, we might eventually force the big fish to adopt it via pressure from the margins. It could happpen, it's a very compelling technology in a lot of ways. It would have to be really, really well-designed - that's key. I think it's do-able.<p>That being said, I want to see what YC-funded clickpass.com is like before I go crazy on some big new effort. If they have a killer solution I may just use that. Also, I doubt YC would appreciate it too much if I start an open-source competitor to one of their companies on hacker news.",1187387872
43630,comment,43534,43624,0,0,portLAN,,,"Probably the best solution is to have a ""posted by"" (editor name) and a ""submitted by"" (user name) like Slashdot.  Alternatively, an ""edited by"" tag added to anything changed after submission.",1187387625

Last nights Facebook Developer Garage pulled in 200 or so.",1187387292
43627,comment,43479,43479,0,0,natrius,,,"That's a pretty naive analysis of the situation. A good Facebook app isn't just some functionality shoved into boxes on people's profiles and canvas pages. You actually have to integrate with the site to make it useful.<p>Any site that does anything remotely social already has it's own friend relationships to help manage that. Putting such a site's functionality into a Facebook app is never going to be as simple as copy and pasting, and if your site isn't social enough to have already necessitated its own friend feature, it's not going to be social enough add any utility as a Facebook app.<p>""Right now, most of the widgets that are out there are an attempt to squeeze the elements of a service into a neat little sidebar rectangle--a bottleneck created by one-way APIs, limited space, and underwhelming goals.""<p>How does his solution solve that?",1187386603

43625,comment,43074,43588,0,0,mangodrunk,,,"You can't ""guess"" any better than flipping a coin when it comes to funding research. They laughed at Bill Gates when he said he wanted control of the software. I think there is room for improvement (which there is for everything) in the funding of research but to call it worthless just because there isn't a direct need or use for something is itself worthless. Any kind of knowledge is useful, no matter what.",1187386496

Editors have fixed titles from day 1. <p>I think the best plan is just to make it policy that submission titles have a different status from comments.  They have to, because all the users have to share the same title for each link.",1187386405
43623,comment,43561,43577,0,0,veritas,,,This is my best guess too.  Damn wiretapping.  I've been cut off for 2 days now.  At least I get more work done... or get more YC News read.,1187386305

43620,comment,43528,43616,0,0,palish,,,"I totally agree.  I was just examining one possibility, however remote, so it could be discounted.  So it's not Facebook.<p>I don't understand why someone would make something popular and then lie about its acquisition though.. Which means I've spun a big old circle back to far33d's original question.",1187385438

43617,comment,43534,43562,0,0,Keios,,,"Paul, \nRegarding your first point:<p>This title could use editing if any title needs editing - ""Fuck Facebook Conversion: Be platform agnostic and use your own APIs. ""\nI appreciate that the title of the blog entry is such, but then the site doesn't look clean with this title. I must also say, I think this aspect of the new changes might be a tad over zealous perhaps even anti-septic.<p>Regarding your second point - \nTitles are made to tempt people to click and most times the original blogger or author might use such a ploy.We might use the original authors title and he may be doing the spinning. How far down the line can you edit?  Again the ""Fuck Facebook"" title is a case in point.<p>I urge you to reconsider the editing. Thoughts? ",1187385093

43615,comment,43525,43602,0,0,samson,,,"Brian i think a wrap system would be a great idea. it would probably be the best way to get a program like this off the ground, while benefiting other webmasters at the same time. Unfortunately such a thing like that reqiures coordination between webmasters (or hackers should i say) that still doesn't exist in the commerical webscene (we all see each other as competitors trying to steal one anothers members). <p>It seems like the only way something like OpenID could get its start is if a big player adopts it like wikipedia and the rest of us follow. <p>But a great creators community is starting to emerge here at ycombinator, perhaps with a forum or something here at hackers news we can lead the way to a universal ID system that would make the web better for everyone.",1187385000
