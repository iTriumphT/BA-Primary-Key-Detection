197908,comment,197878.0,197878.0,0,0,mlopes,,,"I've been using Linux on Servers and Desktop for almost 10 years now, and I still think that's a hard question to answer.\nOn my desktop I use ubuntu, but I would definitely not use it on a server, it would require a hell of a lot of work to get it to be a decent server.\nSome years ago I used to install Red Hat on the servers, and if you are a beginer on Linux that's what I would advise, the Fedora Core.\nI usually install Gentoo on my servers, but if you don't have a steady Linux background that's probably not a good idea. When I say Gentoo I could be saying any other distro where you have full control of all the installation and administration process like slackware.\nAs for Debian, I hear a lot of people praising it but each time I installed it on a server I finished regreting it as they have some weird pre-configurations and configuration files tree for some things and are very purists in others. As an example I could refer vi and apache. Vim as been around forever, and comes with pretty usable pre-configurations in most distros since at leas when I started using Linux but debian still comes with an unconfigured vi for default, not vim. Oposed to that, apache comes with some strange configurations and some strange directory structure and files for the configuration files.",1211540358

Security, stability and available expertise is more important than ability to configure. The self compiled Linux distributions available for your desktop could expose your server to attack.

197906,comment,196597.0,196699.0,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"I dunno, the Python convention is ""if you don't mutate, return a value; if you do mutate, return None."" Since you wrote function('baz', MODULE_LEVEL_CONSTANT) without an assignment in front of it, I would assume that function must mutate something. Since strings are immutable, that just leaves either the display (print) or the second argument. I guess the real point is don't mutate your arguments and print them. Do one or the other, but not both.",1211540106
197905,comment,196597.0,197190.0,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"If your language allows both (+ 1 2) and (+ 2 1) then there's more than one way to do it. There's always more than one way to do it. That's just the nature of languages. Even in pure arithmetic, both 1.99999â€¦ and 2 represent the same number. It's inescapable. The point isn't ""let's only have one way to do it."" The point is to have One Obvious Way To Do It. And that's the Python motto. What this article is doing is showing the mappings between the way you might be used to from other languages to the preferred One Obvious Way of Python.<p>Decrying syntax is nuts. Humans work better if they can pick out visually what's going on. Even Lisp people indent their ifs and defuns. (And if Lisp doesn't have syntax, what the hell do ' or # or (in Arc) [] do?) Now, if we have to have at least a little syntax it's also nice if it's easy to pick out from the visual impression of the syntax what it is that the programmer is getting at. In my opinion, Python does a great job of this.",1211539663
197904,comment,197878.0,197878.0,0,0,lux,,,"I use Debian or Ubuntu (which is based on Debian anyway) since I prefer apt-get over the rpm tools for managing the system.  But really, that's more preference than anything else.  I've used Fedora and Red Hat before that for a long time.<p>They're all fairly similar and pretty much equally configurable as far as servers go.  Just choose one, learn the tools you need, automate with shell scripts, and away you go :)<p>I find that the key for manageability is scripts.  I have a repeatable mostly-automatic process for building new servers from a base install that I've been using and tweaking since my first server, now it handles everything from Apache and MySQL to iptables, backups over rsync+ssh, etc.",1211539357

I mainly used Ubuntu because thats what I have on my desktop, so I was comfortable with setup/installation/config/etc.  If you use linux on your desktop, I'd stick with that, just because a production server isn't the best place to experiment.  If you're new to Linux, Ubuntu is great to start with because theres lots more documentation for it than for other distros.",1211538504

197890,comment,197182.0,197866.0,0,0,listic,,,"Also, your options may vary according to whether you care about any of the following points:\n 1. weight and size (do you want to have your laptop with you all the time and feel light on the go)  \n 2. battery working time (do you want to work on batteries for long periods of time)  \n 3. screen quality and brightness (be prepared that laptops in general are backwards from desktops in this regard)  \n 4. keyboard quality and size  \n 5. drive size, longevity and durability  \n 6. network acess options (some laptops have cellular modem built-in, so theoretically you will be able to stay connected really anywhere; need that?)<p>If you don't care, that's easier for you. If you do care (like me) - then you should do some serious research and, frankly, can still have some backwards thoughts after your purchase.<p>I was in the situation similar to yours, i.e. I wanted a laptop to be able to learn programming in different places. As a long time computer user, I had my specific preferences:\n1. minimum weight and size; I want to have my laptop with me all the time and not feel constrained with it\n2. maximum battery working time. noone thinks that a cell phone that is only able to work half of a day is ok, why is it ok for laptop? in the meanwhile, I want a laptop with a battery life as long as possible.\n3. i wasn't concerned about screen quality, as I don't want to edit images on my laptop but mainly work with text and programs. but now I think screen of my current IBM X60s could really be brighter. it's ok to use in rooms, when not under direct sunlight, but not with the minimum brightness settings. viewing angles are decent, but cold be better too. in general, from what i gather, IBM/Lenovo is very conservative in their choice of screens. In non-Apple world, the only company whose laptops' get frequent praise for their screens is Sony.\n4. i'm very used to desktop keyboard, so the more I was inclined to buy a ThinkPad: their keyboards are often said to be of great quality and the key placement is the closest to desktop that I've seen.\n5. i don't need file storage of great size, but I really want to be sure that my hard drive won't break. so I chose SSD (these models don't come with them standard, the hdd was upgraded manually by the prev. owner)\n6. i wanted to have cellular modem built-in, so I went a bit out of the way to get it: here in Russia the models with WWAN are not sold, so I bought import model and had to unlock it with a special program. It works now!\nalso:\nI needed Windows. In fact I think that open-source OS is the wave of the future, but I don't ride that wave. I'm deeply rooted in Windows. XP is fine for me, don't need Vista.\nmat screen.\n4x3 screen proportions.\nlower dpi screen, please. 1024x768 on 12"" is ok (107 dpi), but higher resolution screens have higher dpi - I have problems with those. I have good vision, but I don't want to strain it.<p>So, after careful consideration, that brought me the following laptop:\nIBM X60s (1702-64M) 12.1 1024x768 | CD 1.66LV | 2GB | 32GB SSD | BT+abg+WWAN(MC8755) [1,5 kg, 6..8 hours of mild work]\nI bought it from a ThinkPads forum member in Australia. I'm generally quite happy with it, but I'm still yet to get adjusted to some issues like the smallish keyboard (maybe a light 14"" would be better? or should I just adjust to this one?) and not very bright screen (it's ok in the room, but when I'm on a bus and there's sunshine in the street and the bus turns - oops, I can't see anything anymore :) - maybe a Sony would be better)",1211537294
197887,comment,197151.0,197285.0,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Totally agree. I've seen these situations arise mostly when managers task problems to be solved as they stumble into them, instead of actually knowing what needs to be done and who will be doing it when.<p>The result is everyone waiting on some guy to clear his MORE critical projects. In a lot of cases, the same projects end up needing a lot more support than they think, simply because they have no clue what development actually involves and didn't plan to train anyone on their own team on that (we'll do what we know how to do first...).<p>Anyway... your point is totally on. Can't say I sympathize much with the company though. This shouldn't be a problem with an empowered team. And blanket messages telling people to just ""go and do it"" sound like a meta-management problem. If you need to blog about it, your company is probably too big for that sort of approach to work.",1211537097

But this is not because trolls down-mod independent thinking, it's just that there is too many trolls UP-modding noise. The trolls themselves don't actively down-mod good/independent ideas.<p>So we are all left with what you call the ""Cory Doctorow Problem"".<p>But any comment (and I stress comment) thats down-modded below a certain point is usually spam, trolling or flamebait anyway, and I can usually rest assured skimming or skipping entirely that post because the crowd have deemed that post not worth my time.<p>Each individual has their own ""Cory Doctorow Problem"", as in your case; (many) other comments which you have made have interesting opinion and/or contain food for thought - that contribute to the discussion - are not down-modded (albeit, not up-modded either as if an opinion is genuinely independent not many people agree with it at that point).<p>As you said, Aggregated news sites get worse over time.<p>In my opinion, the easiest way to fix them is to create a private, invite only aggregated news site, with respected members of a community.
