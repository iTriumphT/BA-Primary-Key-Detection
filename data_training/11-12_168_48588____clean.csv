YC puts up a bit of funding and takes a small cut.<p>More importantly, I think is that it's giving young programmers a big leg up in understanding how the VC game is played and an opportunity to build a software career that is very independent. For really good programmers I suppose there is always demand, always a place to work and more or less define your own path. But if you sell your company for 15 mill, you get a nice piece of what I like to call FU money.<p>I've sort of followed this YC project from the beginning as an outsider and my sense is that the folks behind YC are putting back some of their good fortunes. It's a cool way to  spend some of their money and possibly grow it even more.<p>All the negative press and trash talk about burned out programmers, etc. looks to me like a good measure of success. The others are looking at the backs of your sneakers",1219060486

Such a concept would require as the very first step that we must let go of our usual observational abilities, as they are unable to step outside of time. So, first we have to discover how to observe, and only then can we start to experiment.",1219059659

This doesn't need to be done if there are attributes or if you've defined the size of its container etc.<p>For the second point, it's a comment that browsers have a limit to maximum persistent connections per server and a larger limit for maximum persistent connections overall. It naively uses the domain to define what a server is, so splitting over multiple subdomains will make it faster (see  <a href=""http://www.ajaxperformance.com/2006/12/18/circumventing-browser-connection-limits-for-fun-and-profit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ajaxperformance.com/2006/12/18/circumventing-brow...</a>). Incidentally, one of the big changes in FireFox 3 was to increase the number of persistent connections per server and IE8 is going to do the same thing.

For the technical co-founder (the person who writes the code) YC offers the opportunity to complete avoid the ""professionals"" that are brought in to run things (often into the ground). Sarah makes her living writing PR fluff to support those same people. YC is a direct threat to her source of income, and thus needs to be attacked.",1219058158

279159,comment,277948.0,279155.0,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Science in its current form wasn't prevalent back when people were saying that the Earth couldn't be round. Any modern day scientist would always be open to the possibility, given physical evidence. The very best model at the time showed that the earth was flat-- hey, it looks flat when you go outside. But evidence through experimentation led to the model being updated.<p>Electrons are small and you can't see them with your eyeballs. But J.J. Thomson used models of how cathode rays work and how electrical conduction works, and he hypothesized and then experimentally showed that electrons exist. They may not exist, and any good scientist would be open to that possibility, given evidence. But the best models we have today show that they do exist.<p>Observation and experimentation are one level beyond assumption. They're assumption backed by evidence. Blind assumption is to ""suppose a case is true without proof.""<p>Imagination drives science, true. But nothing imagined is <i>ever</i> considered science, or even possible, without some kind of evidence.<p>Uncertainty is fine. Is there dark matter? Is it possible to travel faster than the speed of light? Why are photons both particles and waves? Uncertainty is what makes these the interesting questions in science.",1219057853
