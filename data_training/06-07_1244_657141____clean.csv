If it was &quot;real&quot; enough, you wouldn&#x27;t need a contrived example.<p>> <i>and, in the article, is directly responsible for a bug.</i><p>Nope! It was not responsible for anything whatsoever. Yeah, the backslashes got escaped, but they were <i>already</i> broken, so it didn&#x27;t actually break anything. All it did was make &quot;btest&quot; match instead of &quot;\x08test&quot; match (both of which are equally buggy, though &quot;btest&quot; is more likely to be triggered in the wild).<p>> <i>Are you really arguing that we could make C</i> less <i>confusing by switching printf(&quot;%d&quot;, x) to printf(&quot;\\d&quot;, x)?</i><p>No. I did not say that at all, and I don&#x27;t appreciate straw man arguments.<p>> <i>I&#x27;d say that C strings and C format directives use different escape characters</i> specifically because <i>they&#x27;re likely to be used together</i><p>I doubt it. Neither of us was present (I&#x27;m assuming) when the printf format spec was decided upon, but I&#x27;d wager that % was chosen because this has a semantically different meaning than backslash-escapes. Backslash escapes are just that: escapes. They&#x27;re either stand-ins for certain un-typeable characters, or they disable interpretation of the following character. But % in printf isn&#x27;t used as a character escape, it&#x27;s used as a <i>token</i>. It&#x27;s a stand-in for a more complicated representation of a separate argument. And the fact that it behaves differently than \ does warrants it using a different character.<p>Whereas in other languages, \ typically has the exact same semantic meaning as \ does in C strings (the set of character escapes may vary slightly, although most languages tend to copy C&#x27;s character escapes verbatim). And that&#x27;s why they use \. It&#x27;s the same reason most languages use &quot;&quot; to denote strings, or [] to denote subscripting. It&#x27;s common punctuation that behaves the same across multiple languages, which makes it easy for the programmer to remember and work with.",1441694332

You could pay extra to have the app baked into a custom rom to make it non-removable.<p>The business model from our end is we&#x27;d find app developers who are willing to pay X amount per install (a conversion was usually tracked by the first time an end user opens the app), and then we pay Y amount per install to a shady phone re-seller to bake that app into the rom of their latest batch of phones. As long as X is sufficiently higher than Y to account for whatever our conversion rate is, we make our money back plus profits as the app developer pays us for conversions.<p>The shady re-sellers would take their phones with new roms and either sell direct to consumer or, in the case of the bigger guys, move those phones on to a big-box retailer.",1441693437
