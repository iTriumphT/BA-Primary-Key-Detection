Technology has been key to human evolution since man learned to create fire and sharp sticks. As such, we are inextricably bound to our technology. Having better tech is most certainly an evolutionary advantage. These days, technology is progressing so fast that it can be difficult to keep up.<p>What are the repercussions of not keeping up? Well, you've seen what happened to the tribal folk that got owned by Europeans back in the day, right? If you don't keep up with technology, you will fall behind in the evolutionary chain. Just hope those higher on the chain than you have some compassion and lack the desire to conquer/eat you.<p>The article makes an excellent point that our children need to be  computer and technology literate. Those that do not embrace technology will forever be collecting the second-hand  table-scrap-tech that we throw out. As any parent, we want our children to have all the opportunities that other kids have. Knowledge is power.",1257127244
