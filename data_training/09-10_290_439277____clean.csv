Example: www is for english, de is for german, fr is for french and so on. The reason I did this is because I wanted Google to index the sites properly, in the right language. So if you go to google.fr and search for some of its keywords you would see the french version and not the english one. I'm just not sure how Google behaves but my feeling is that if all your languages are on the same domain (without any difference on the URL) then it will always display the english one by default (assuming it's the default one, obviously). Can anyone enlighten me?<p>It's been working for me but I notice the english version (which is the default one, www, but not the one with most visits) is not working as good as the other languages so I'd say juice is not shared between subdomains, like Patrick said.

I choose .eu since I'm in Europe and not .com since it is not my commercial activity (I have other domains for that), .org on the other hand seems more for organisations and my blog is a one man operation :-) As an additional factor I have to admit to work for the .eu registry so of course I want to promote the .tld a bit but that was more a happy side effect, my business domain for example is a .be since I target small companies within my region.",1320830456

Fixing sleeping routines I think is the most important part of that; getting a decent bedroom has also been important.  Three most important things: no light, no noise, and good air.  Move away from a noisy street; heavy blackout curtains over an open window will help with the rest. Blackout curtains seem to be less common in the States than in Europe: do track them down if you haven't got them.<p>Caffeine: I'm quite happy drinking tea as my bedtime drink.  Coffe, though, keeps me awake.  I have no idea why, since the caffeine levels are about the same.  I try to minimise my coffee consumption over the week.<p>Artificial lighting is a good point, artificial heating and air circulation I also find to be bad for your body's self-regulation.  Up to a point, I think these things matter more than diet.  I like to work in a cold office with warm clothes.<p>Polyphasic sleep: It's interesting, but I think that Dustin Curtis only find it works better than normal sleep because he is unable to establish a routine that works for him. otherwise.",1320830014

For eg. Google will figure out the shorter canonical link for a domain. So if you have www.lakers.com redirect to lakers.nba.com Google will treat 'lakers.com' as the canonical link and rewrite all the search results.<p>This can be exploited by registering a shorter domain and then pointing it to the real site, then waiting for Google to redirect it. For eg. Fred Wilson noticed that the guy who owns avc.com was redirecting to his blog. He thought the guy was being a good samaritan, until I pointed out that it was a cloak attack and he was trying to jack all of avc.blogs.com's Google juice.<p>You can avoid this by not letting Google or Bing setting the canonical and by specifying it with a rel='canonical' link or using Webmaster Tools.

We saw no jump in number of blog links, or tumblr's, or anything else.<p>The buttons suck - we knew that a lot of users hated them (it adds 4 * 20 additional HTTP requests to the main page), but they were worth too much traffic to do away with. Social network referrals likely surpass search engine referrals for a lot of blogs and web sites. They have steadily become an important web traffic navigator.<p>If somebody can figure out how to make those share buttons prettier and more efficient there is probably a product in that. I would guess that most blogs would love to drop the grid of share buttons that can be found on every post.<p>Otherwise I totally agree with not going for subdomains. We setup each property on a separate domain and initially had some on subdomains. The subdomains didn't rank at all and didn't help our PR or SEO. As soon as we switched each property to a separate domain our search referrals rocketed. For eg. you can now find a crunchbase link within the first 5 results for the name of a startup, while similar records for posts that lived on subdomains wouldn't rank at all. We had around a dozen different domains and frequently linked between them (for eg. each post would have multiple crunchbase links), and it worked really well for search ranking (search engines are ~40% of crunchbase traffic, IIRC) It shouldn't be like that, but it is.",1320829711

Typically we're talking about being ""offended"" or ""taken aback"" (Scott Hanselman's post). From my trusty Apple dictionary I find that offense means ""annoyance or resentment brought about by a perceived insult to or disregard for oneself or one's standards or principles"".<p>So essentially this is a whole argument about annoyance caused by a choice of language. When it's said ""I'm offended that someone with his talent takes the easy way out."" it's further revealed that the annoyance is not coming from any high moral ground but is purely stylistic. All the talk about ""do(ing) better"" or cursing being a ""crutch"" is a red herring.<p>Further, this offense is caused by ""disregard for oneself or <i>one's standards or principles</i>"". It's rather arrogant to think that anyone should have any regard for your standards standards or principles at all. It's time to grow up and realize that getting upset by the particular style of another's words is a waste of your time and attention.",1320829598
