Sure.  Significantly?  No.  For global warming data, there's all sorts of crapola, fixed up with Finkel's Fudge Factor, smoothed, filtered, collected from unspecified places by unclear means, etc.  E.g., there is tree ring data which is very crude and next to useless for discussing global warming.<p>For the $500 K per year per prof in field and experimental science, that's not their ""compensation"".  The $120 K a year you mentioned is closer.  My $10 million was within the ballpark, within a factor of only 2 from the data you found.  Next, the CEO salaries have nothing to do with global warming or climate change.<p>An great example of bad data is Al Guru's movie.  Again, he blew the Vostok ice core data and neglected to note that the CO2 increases were hundreds of years after the temperature increases.  So, clearly CO2 did not cause the temperature increases.<p>Al Guru's pictures of polar bears and glaciers are meaningless and not ""good"" data.  Similarly for his observation of snows on Kilimanjaro.  So, Guru wanted to bring in lots of anecdotal this and that instead of what is clearly the crucial measure for global warming -- temperature, just temperature.<p>The bad data and analysis goes on and on.  Guru is trying to make money (he has), be famous (he is), and push his favorite project, scaring people about global warming.  It's likely a religious thing with him, considering his background.  Whatever his motives are, his evidence and arguments are BS.<p>For the IPCC, it's really no better.  'Radiative forcing' is total made up crack pot BS.  Really the IPCC is about getting 'carbon credit' transfer payments from wealthy countries to poor ones.<p>Yet the global warming people want us to go to electric power at the plant from about 2 cents per KWH to about 50 cents, convert to electric cars for which there are no feasible batteries for how the vast majority of cars are used, even to convert long haul trucks to batteries which is absurd, and on and on.  It's the same as the Mayan priests killing people to pour their blood on rocks to keep the sun moving across the sky.<p>Just what is it about total BS crapola you find so attractive?  Dump it.

A lot of this is actually due to gameplay-via-code and thus attributable pretty directly to Carmack.  Turning feels right, movement feels right (not realistic -- right, there's a difference), shooting feels right, jumping feels right.

The problem you get with larger groupings of words is lack of cohesion.  If you trained it at a sentence level, you might be able to produce coherent sentences.  But as you generated more sentences to produce a paragraph, it would likely meander.<p>I created a kind of Mad Lib generator using CFGs.  A paragraph consisted of: [Intro] [Supporting sentence 1] [Supporting sentence 2] [Supporting sentence 3] ... [Conclusion].  All the sentences had placeholders for various nouns and adjectives that could later be filled in programmatically, and I extended the grammar spec to both permute sets of sentences and generate null productions with certain probabilities.<p>The base sentences were created by humans, about 15 per grammar rule.  A single person could create a topic-based paragraph/grammar in less than two work days.  The chances of it creating the same template twice was about one in a billion.  Of course, the probability varied depending on how many seed sentences were present.<p>If the person writing the seed sentences is literate and passed the 6th grade, then everything the program generates is indistinguishable from human text.<p>It works marvelously.",1308043917

2652324,comment,2651090.0,2652252.0,1,0,huetsch,,,I love the 3.1 rcs but using 3rd party css files that reference images are kind of painful to deal with in conjunction with the asset pipeline. I find myself making awkward directory structures in the vendor directory to avoid making modifications to 3rd party css libraries (like jQuery UI). I'm hoping a lot of this will go away when those things are packed into gems that I can just put in my Gemfile and forget. I'm sure Compass and Blueprint will get to that point pretty quickly but I'm not sure that something custom-generated like by jQuery UI ThemeRoller will ever be smooth to set up.,1308042909

You'd dial the person whose door you wanted to connect to, they'd authorize it (perhaps after a small conversation) and the two door frames would create a portal to each other's room, as if the rooms were connected.<p>This is nothing more than an interesting thought experiment, but I figured that it would already make <i>all</i> forms of transformation obsolete, except perhaps for ones used for leisure. Everything would be much cheaper, as you could basically just carry everything from production to distribution to people's homes within a few seconds.<p>It would also probably make most forms of <i>communication</i> obsolete, as you could just walk into the next room and see your friends, and you could go out in any place in the world, so it would also revolutionize travel.<p>Physical shops would be turned into their online equivalents, as locality would no longer play any part in anything, but they would only exist for the pleasure (and marketing) of physically shopping. Actually, I can't decide whether online stores would perish instead...<p>Anyway, it's an interesting world to contemplate.",1308042902

Deployment of PHP is the same as deployment of static HTML. How is that not simpler than what we got in rails. For rails you need to understand version control, webservers and scripting. For PHP you need to understand copy.<p>For a serious project I think rails is great but you can't deny it involves lots of abstractions which sometimes break down and then necessitate expert knowledge that most people don't have.",1308042809

2652317,story,,,2,2,UK_throw_away,What the **** should I do with my startup,,"I am a UK based IT consultant involved in a couple of start-ups over the last 4-5 years. In the last year, I decided to go it alone, but have no experience of programming. Having access to a great team of developer in Eastern Europe, I developed the idea of a video sharing start-up. Design were created by a very close friend and high talented designer. The iPhone app was deveopled and ready to ship, however, the web developer had a terrible bike accident and was out of action. I waited over 3 weeks before speaking to second developer and work restart after an additonal week lost. 4 week later, the second developer went AWOL. At the time, I had health issues so chasing was not an option. Another months passed and here we are, the developer, (Moroccan) had kidney issues and has been in hospital for a month in is also out of action. I have all but lost interest in working on a start-up due to my limitations as a programmer to pick up the pieces and it is very frustrating waiting for developers to get back to you. A fair amount of time (and money) has gone in to this project.<p>Am broke and tired (unwell), struggling to decided what to do next!<p>Should I sell the idea, design and software? (More to the point, would anyone be interested in buying it!) and if so, what would be the best place to do this.<p>Does anyone have any experience in selling half-baked projects with great potential?<p>Detailed image of project may be posted if requested",1308042570

2652304,comment,2651090.0,2651930.0,2,0,flocial,,,"I think Java deployment is pretty straightforward and php is dead simple.  I guess it depends on how much traffic your site gets but the larger your Rails site gets the more moving parts you end up with (at a lot less traffic than say a Java stack), higher server specs, reliance on memcache, some proxy, etc. just for a standard dynamic website.  Sure you can wrap that deployment dance into a Capistrano recipe but it's not inherently simple.<p>But the main point is that since Rails/Ruby requires a lot more resources (cpu, ram, etc.) and wraps a lot up into a black box (auto-generated queries that might have a deadly join or two), when you deploy it's more ""thrilling"" for want of a better word.<p>I'm not saying Rails sucks completely, but the programmer productivity thing is oversold because in a small shop, the dev guys are usually babysitting servers too.  This and some whimsical api changes can dampen your enthusiasm a bit.  I just wanted to emphasize that some Rails enthusiasts are zealously in a state of denial of Rails/Ruby short-comings and putting a Rails app in production/deployment can be a bit challenging.  Like others have said, the number of startups focused on making deployment and scaling of Rails apps ""easy"" kind of says something.",1308042074
