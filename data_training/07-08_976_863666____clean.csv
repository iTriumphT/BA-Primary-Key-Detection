1234131,comment,1233673.0,1233673.0,0,0,brainlock,,,"Maybe a bit late, but here is my experience.<p>At the end of the job search I had to choose among two companies. One was developing in python, the other in php. At first I felt inclined towards the python-based one, mainly because of my taste in programming languages. I had sweared to myself I wouldn't do java, asp or php, and like you I was disappointed at the fact that the vast majority of job offers required those languages.<p>After getting to know both, however, I ended up going to the php-based company.<p>I realised that what I actually dislike of java & co., more than the languages themselves, is the mindset that the people pushing them _often_ have. Mind you, often, not always. And that was the key.<p>The people at my company started this project about 10 years ago, and at the time php was the natural choice. They're not the old-aged, process oriented, boring, enterprise-y. They're agile, quick, creative, curious. We use git, introduced and extremely cool release management strategy, started a new project in python, moved a lot of the functionality on the client (on the browser), and so far even the work on the php backend has been a lot of fun (~1 year into this job).<p>I'd say the key factor is: do they have a hacking mindset or a process-enterprise mindset? With the right people php can be fun too :-)",1270108602

However, I still don't quite understand why you'd want to use the same rules for the rest of the world.<p>Your credit card company cannot possibly validate my address (with zip code) and telephone in a rigid US-based form, because I won't be able to enter my zip code or my telephone into that form. They simply won't fit and validators won't let them through. Also, many systems won't process non-ASCII characters in my street name.<p>Of course, I have been entering crap data into those forms for the last few years when buying online and have yet to see a credit card transaction rejected. Which means you don't have to worry about rejected transactions on out-of-country purchases, which means you might as well give us a reasonable form and not expect us to fight our way through your validators.<p>So why not make two forms -- one for US customers, and one for everyone who chooses a different country?

It's not really the degree itself, it's specialization. I'd also suggest specializing in something technical (what is that you're passionate about?) rather than generic ""software engineering"" (i.e., UML diagrams) or management (what are you going to manager). These sorts of ""professional"" engineering masters degrees mean more if you've already been in the industry (much like an MBA) and want to move to people or project management.<p>You can also work in the industry for a few years and then go for a masters. That has the advantage of showing you what you'd want to focus on and letting you take risks with your career prior to a masters (additional degree lets you reset a career). The disadvantage is that going back (especially if you are happy with your career) is hard. It's also easy to build up an industry arrogance (I found it in myself) and gloss over lectures when the way things are done in industry is different -- only to realize in a few years (when someone else builds a real-world system on an ""academic"" concept) that someone in academia had an answer to a problem you're only realized you're having <i>now</i> 30 years ago, but you dismissed as theoretical and impractical.<p>You can also do what I did: work full time <i>and</i> do your masters. Just be prepared to have a limited social life and less sleep for the next 3 years (you won't be able to take a full time academic load at all times while working). Not only does this mean you don't have to go into debt (and/or voluntary poverty) to get through graduate school, in many cases your employer can pay for part of this (although this limits you to companies big enough to provide tuition reimbursement).",1270106544
