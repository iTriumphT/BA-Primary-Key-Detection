I could've done it at 19, I probably could even have done it at 24, but now that I'm 29, I just can't code for 14 hours a day, let alone 20.  (Actually, that's not entirely true - I've pulled 14 hour days for 4-5 day stretches working on a Google doodle or coming up to a launch, but I need like 2 weeks of recovery time afterwards.)  Alas, I wasted my twenties on college and 3 failed startups.<p>It's certainly <i>possible</i> to start a company in your 30s - PG did it, founding ViaWeb at 31 and selling it at 34 - but it does seem like a bit of an uncanny valley without many founders.  My theory is that people who are the type of person that's going to found a startup probably would've founded it by 26, and then if their first couple attempts failed, they're licking their wounds at 30 and trying to figure out how to give it another go.<p>Those same people often end up starting follow-up ventures much later, after the kids are self-sufficient.  I have one friend from elementary school whose dad is working on his second startup at the age of 70.  His first venture - founded at around age 60 - ended up IPOing at a market cap of several billion before crashing and burning.",1304560551

PayPal got scammed too. They don't have the stolen funds he was paid with. If the payment was funded by credit card, PayPal not only doesn't have the money but also paid a chargeback fee on it. They're actually willing to use their own money on top of that to pay for the stolen items if the seller shipped them to the PayPal account's address -- great! But the OP didn't, so he's in the same place he'd be if he were paid with a bad check or directly with a stolen credit card -- all he can do is take the scammer to court, if he's ever found.<p>Re the final line: ""I urge PayPal to do the right thing and correct this issue immediately, lest I be driven to seek legal options to recover what I believe is legally owed to me."" The party that owes him money is the person that placed the bid on eBay, not the means by which he made a fraudulent payment. When someone pays a store with a bad check, it's not the bank that's sued, it's the check writer.",1304558556

I first heard about bitcoin on HN when they were worth around .01 each, and could be generated fairly easily by simply running the mining software in the background. I was so busy spotting the flaw in the electricity cost creation argument I missed the fact it wouldn't matter, because the algorithm gets harder so only ""professional"" miners likely end up generating the majority of new coins, and also that there is a cap at 21 million, so generating coins was planned to stop anyway. (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1655202"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1655202</a>)<p>I was looking at bitcoins as they might compare to an established currency model, like dollars, where the rate of creation has to be controlled smartly (not that I'm saying it is) and indefinitely. Satisfied I had spotted a money creation flaw preventing bitcoins becoming a dominant new currency I dismissed them quickly, never noticing the other aspects of brilliance it has.<p>I still see problems with bitcoin becoming a fully fledged sustained and mature currency. Some of these have been articulated here on HN (notably by jerf). However, I believe bitcoins still have developmental stages to go through before failing, and because of this I actually still see upside for them as a speculative (still risky) investment. I doubt I would do anything with them now, but if I had got in at .01 cent, now that would be different.",1304558551

About two days later he opened a simple yes/no poll about the current experiment<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2445039"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2445039</a><p>and 14 days ago he replied to a question with a preliminary report on how voting behavior has changed.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465271"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465271</a><p>The latest long comment thread about the experiment included several comments suggesting that voting power be separated from being able to view comment karma scores directly. (In other words, a user setting would choose whether the user wants to see comment karma scores or be able to vote on comments.) I thought about that issue for a few days, off-site. It seems to me that there are several possible responses to the suggestion that voting power be separated from visibility of comment karma scores. Perhaps the learned readers here can suggest other possible responses, and analyze which makes the most sense.<p>Should Voting Power Be an Option Separated from Viewing Comment Karma Scores?<p>1) Yes, then some readers can skim threads for information, while others vote on comments, and everyone is happy.<p>2) Yes, because readers can skim threads for information, even if that inconveniences voters.<p>3) No, because comment karma scores are misleading as a guide to what to read. (See pg's post from just before when the experiment began.)<p>4) No, because everyone should be able to vote, and everyone should have a clue about which comments have a high score (through colors or fonts or approximate scores).<p>5) No, because the interface should be like it was last month, when everyone could see comment karma scores and could vote based on personal karma.<p>6) No, because HN users will use sockpuppets to get around any such distinction between viewing karma and voting.<p>Personally, I haven't committed myself to any one position on this issue, or indeed even committed myself to an opinion on whether this is a fitting way to look at how to improve the site or not. I defer to the site founder on all issues of site governance. I have found HN largely to be a worthwhile website for my 898 days as a registered user, and my interest is mostly to make sure that the site founder and the members of his volunteer editor (""curator"") team<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html</a><p>continue to enjoy the site and find it useful for themselves. They are doing a good job, and I want them to have incentive to keep up the good work.<p>When pg wrote his recent post ""Ask HN: How to stave off decline of HN?""<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p>He wrote, ""The problem has several components: comments that are (a) mean and/or (b) dumb that (c) get massively upvoted.""<p>That's still the key issue. If some change of voting rules or comment karma visibility brings about higher scores for good comments, and lower scores for mean, dumb, or other bad comments, that is helpful to all readers of HN. Feel free to review the site guidelines<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>and the site welcome message<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html</a><p>for guidance on what is desired here and thus guidance on how to vote.<p>P.S. The last time there was a long thread discussing voting rules, some users wondered out loud about whether or not registering a new account requires reading the guidelines before voting. It does not, as I found out the other day by using a university library terminal that doesn't have my cookies stored to register a noob experiment account. A brand-new account has upvoting power immediately, and has a link to the welcome page shown on the top navigation bar, where it may be noticed (as I noticed it) or may not.",1304558010
