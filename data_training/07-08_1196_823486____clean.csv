The most important thing should be the headlines on hacker news. That's how it was designed to be. Everything else should pale in color compared to it.<p>3) As SeoxyS mentioned, I designed mine as to not disrupt the functionality that everyone's used to. What I did was ""design"" the page to improve readability. I made the background color behind the text a light grey so it's not as gloomy as the current site and used a dark grey font rather than the black on current site to improve faster reading. Black on white is always tiring on the eyes, which is why I tried to adapt different shades of grey.<p>4) I don't like HN's top nav bar right now because it takes focus away from the logo. The logo should be consistent with the one found and recognized on YC's main site. A logo on the site should be loud and clear. I made the top nav bar a darker grey so that it would give focus back to the logo.\n5) The selected links are now orange instead of white. By having tiny accents of color, it adds the kind of eye candy that you want but nonetheless tied in with functionality. UX comes first, then UI. You can make something pretty after think about how you'll first make it user-friendly.<p>6) To improve eye candy, I gave the bottom nav the bright color of HN to really lighten up the page. I felt that otherwise there would be too many grey areas.<p>7) I moved the search to the top and yes, this does change what the users are used to, but in my opinion a good change. I've read many posts where people (including myself) have had a hard time finding the search button. To move it to the top nav will adapt to web standards.<p>Normally, I'd make the search larger and start right aligned at the end of the top nav bar and instead move the username + logout link above it, but I felt that it might be too disruptive, so I sacrificed what looks the best for a better experience (this is important).",1334993907

3871193,comment,3870964.0,3870964.0,2,0,eaurouge,,,Neat! I was just researching SVG and Canvas for a drawing application.  Apparently SVG performance degrades as you increase the number of objects but it can handle changes in scale (zooming in for instance) much better than Canvas can.  It seems you've gone with SVG (Raphael) for all your rendering.  Have you seen any performance degradation in your tests?,1334992452

For example, there are two different tax rates which you might be paying -- one for capital gains and certain dividends, and one for income. The first is always taxed at a lower rate. Meanwhile, you have a ""deduction"" -- an amount of money that you're allowed to deduct from your return as if you'd never gotten it in the first place.<p>The IRS forms actually implement a worksheet which just says, ""subtract your deduction from your income, and if your deduction is larger than your income, subtract whatever else there is from your capital gains.""<p>At least, I <i>think</i> that's what it does. As this article shows, you have no conscious idea what the heck you're <i>really</i> doing when the IRS invites you to play Turing Machine.",1334992117
