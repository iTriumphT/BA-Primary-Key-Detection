Opcache is part of PHP now, yet it&#x27;s Zend branded everywhere and has a bus factor of one (nobody can understand the source code except a Zend employee - every time anything&#x27;s changed in the engine, Opcache breaks and he has to go and fix it). Similarly, it&#x27;s not good that the Zend Engine is marked with a Zend Technologies copyright notice either. It&#x27;s the core PHP runtime, yet if you read the notices you&#x27;d think it was some proprietary product donated by or licensed from them.",1425099519

You say, just moments earlier, that <i>variables are called by that name because they can change over time, they’re mutable</i>. But this <i>variable</i> is immutable? But only sometimes? !<p>I know you mean that the mutability varies and that it makes sense in the context of the jargon of functional languages, but that&#x27;s something that will make sense to language developers who have worked on Rust for years and maybe to the HN crowd, and not to new coders trying to grasp difficult, novel (to them) concepts.<p>How about &quot;multimode bindings&quot; or &quot;multiphase bindings&quot; (as in liquid/solid phase transitions) or dual-mode or something more entertaining like &quot;double-agent bindings&quot;. Is it too late to change?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but I suspect years from now people will be saying, &#x27;so <i>variable</i> bindings are not always variable? huh?&#x27;",1425099413

What other CMS can turn itself into an eCommerce store, blog, business website, magazine, etc with a few small tweaks?<p>I hear a lot of these comments from very well respected developers, but as a user and webmaster (not a developer) of WordPress I am very satisfied with it, and rarely see a WordPress site that runs slow, with the exceptions of poorly coded themes which will slow down ANY CMS.<p>I manage a lot of websites, probably 200 or so of them are WordPress. Over the last 5 years I&#x27;ve seen about 5 hacks, 3 were due to outdated plugins and 2 were brute forced. Backups are incredibly easy (file structure and database) for an end user with plugins, and maintenance for an average WordPress takes about 20 minutes per month.<p>I think this discussion is very positive in the fact that the core of WordPress is very outdated and has not really been touched in the last 5 years (or more?) or so. I&#x27;d love to see version 5 or 6 be a full re-write or even a partial rewrite of the main functions and core includes, perhaps even a more efficient language but that is not really my territory. The problem I see with all that is backwards compatibility. There are so many themes, plugins, and addons that depend on WordPress core hooks, I don&#x27;t know how that could work seamlessly. I suppose that is what beta testing is for.<p>As I&#x27;ve already said in this thread, WordPress is a huge success in the mainstream and is gaining in popularity every day. 75 million WP sites last I checked vs a fraction of that in Drupal and Joomla.<p>Node is on the rise but is still a custom solution and not deployable unless you are a skilled developer with knowledge of the network stack.<p>We live in an age where end users want to be able to control their website backend. They want to blog, make changes to static pages, add images from events and even add their own products. Have you ever tried to teach someone to do this in Joomla and Drupal?

9122818,comment,9121797.0,9122269.0,0,0,tmzt,,,"I would say the entire mechanism for extensions that can interact with pages is broken.<p>First, taking Chrome as an example, extensions are given the permission to see, track and interact with all pages loaded in the browser. Essentially, they can inject code, but they can also directly pull data from fill-in forms and other places.<p>Of course, these are the things that people use extensions for, so the ability to modify pages makes sense. Take one of the original extensions that was was used to modify pages at runtime, Greasemonkey. It was designed to attach a user.css to the page, or to run a transform on the page and inject specific DOM elements. Of course, there was nothing stopping an injected piece of script for posting data to a third party, but a cursory examination of the particular Greasemonkey customization would show that immediately, and the script could be flagged and removed from the collection.<p>Now we have extensions that do much more than these user scripts did in Greasemonkey and are self contained and harder to break apart and study. Two examples, Feedly which is my chosen replacement for Reader, has an extension which places a Feedly icon on every page. It doesn&#x27;t add it to the browser chrome but actually adds it to the DOM of every single page that loads. As similar example is a Chrome extension for managing cookies, but which had a donation function that placed links on pages to donate to the project or something of the sort. Either of these could be accomplished with a small installable transform, and neither required the extension itself to have access to the DOM, the transform script could have handled the limited functionality of enumerating RSS/ATOM links or whatever the other extension did. But both of those extensions requested the amorphous permission of modifying every page you access.<p>In Firefox, at least until recently, unsigned extensions could execute native code in the form of XPCOM libraries, they could modify the entire chrome and run with the same permissions as the browser itself. They could intercept not only DOM calls but low level calls in browser js files which also ran with chrome permissions.<p>By reading a configuration file for a unique string, or, in some cases, guessing, you could find a path where placing a zip file or directory was enough to install an extension, so these extensions rode alongside installers for applications, BHOs in Internet Explorer that also installed themselves into Firefox, and other places that would have a chance of destroying a users experience and perception of Firefox.",1425098520

9122753,comment,9109801.0,9111202.0,0,0,rcthompson,,,"Others have already explained it well enough, but I&#x27;ll just add a few important concepts. First, if you remember nothing else, remember this: the p-value has absolutely nothing to do with the alternative hypothesis. In the context of p-values, there is no alternative hypothesis; it doesn&#x27;t exist. The p-value only says anything about the relationship of your data to the null hypothesis. The second thing to keep in mind is that any null hypothesis likely has lots of assumptions built in to it, and if any of those is violated, the associated p-value is invalid. So you should always be aware of what those assumptions are, and try to verify that your data satisfied then if possible. (Almost no one does this, of course.) For example, the standard t-test assumes, among other things, that your data is normally distributed and that all groups have equal variance. If either of these assumptions is violated, the test is invalid.<p>Lastly, if you&#x27;re in a situation where you&#x27;re performing a large number of tests, always correct for multiple testing (i.e. false discovery rate or some similar method). Also, you can take advantage of your large data set to construct a negative control (e.g. by shuffling samples, the exact method will vary) and verify that your chosen statistical test gives a flat distribution of p-values, which is the expected result when all of the null hypotheses are true. If you have an excess of small p-values in the null data set, this indicates your test is producing false positives and is not reliable (presumably because one or more assumptions have been violated).",1425096458

So, nine months before the lawsuits started, PMI put its Australian business in the hands of its Hong Kong-based Philip Morris Asia division, and then they sued, claiming that the &quot;seized property&quot; in question, were the trademarks on their cigarette packages.&quot;</i><p>Another dispute, between Canada and Eli Lilly on IP, <a href=""http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/02/11/canadian-reply-to-500-million-us-pharma-suit-guesses-dont-make-valid-patents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/02/11/canadian-reply-to...</a><p><i>&quot;The Canadian government has delivered a scathing response to a $500 million lawsuit from the American pharmaceutical industry, dissecting the intellectual-property practices of the company that launched the case.  .. Eli Lilly had filed for 12 separate patents between 1992 and 2004 claiming it could treat psoriasis, stuttering, incontinence, hot flashes, anxiety, learning disabilities, tic disorders and, finally, ADHD.  .. “Canadian law does not grant patents for almost-inventions,” said the submission. “Even if the applicant’s speculation at the time of filing is later confirmed.”</i><p>There is a proposed US-EU equivalent of the Australia - Hong Kong arbitration panel for ISDS (Investor-State Dispute Settlement) in TTIP, <a href=""http://www.computerworlduk.com/blogs/open-enterprise/ttip-update-l-3596807/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworlduk.com/blogs/open-enterprise/ttip-up...</a><p><i>&quot;So what the European Commission is proposing with the dispute resolution chapter is how future clashes with the US over those key social constructs should be resolved.

And remember: &quot;The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be unconditionally accepted by the Parties.&quot;  So if, for whatever reason, the arbitration panel says a well-established regulation protecting health and safety, or the environment, has to go, well, it has to go, even if the vast majority of the public that it will effect disagrees.&quot;</i>",1425096419
