952221,comment,951954.0,951954.0,0,0,abhiyerra,,,"I found fault in the student protests even though these fees are going to affect me quite a bit next semester. It seems the money being raised is being spent to keep all the engineering, business, economics, and law professors around while the other majors are likely going to suffer severe cuts or flat out closure. I know for the Hacker News crowd those previous majors are likely the ones that matter most. Unfortunately, Berkeley offers a great deal of interesting classes where the professors will either leave or they will be cut. Linguistics and history to name a few personal favorites (Disclosure: I am a history major) are going to be two such classes. As much as people like to see a degree in terms of economic potential, of how much money a person can make with a degree, in the end it is about knowledge no matter what field you study. In my experience while I felt that computer science taught me a whole lot about computers, studying history has taught me a lot more about life.<p>I am not blaming the administration for the fee increases. They might be large and bureaucratic, but they nonetheless have higher ups that they are responsible to. The real blame goes to the people of California and its legislature. All tax increases in the assembly have to be voted by a 2/3 majority while a tax decreases do not. This is near impossible as the assemblymen and assemblywomen tend to be along hardcore party lines. Further, adding Prop 13 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_(1978)#Negative_effects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_(1978...</a>) has not helped at all making it near impossible. Ending Prop 13 would give the state quite a bit in revenue to continue funding higher education and fund many of the chronic deficits California faces. Unfortunately, even though the California public views higher education as an important goal they also want low taxes at the same time which is impossible to sustain (if 8 years of Bush have taught us anything). Those are opposing goals!<p>Professor Lakoff is attempting to propose a ballot which will change the tax initiatives to majority rules. It simply reads, ""All legislative actions on revenue and budget must be determined by a majority vote."" It is called the California Democracy Act (<a href=""http://www.californiademocracyact.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.californiademocracyact.com</a>)",1258714068

952213,comment,952015.0,952191.0,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"EDIT: This got down-modded, and I'm not sure why.  You may disagree with it, but I think it adds value to the discussion.  I've touched it lightly to make it slightly more generic, but I still stand by what it says.  Teaching is hard, math is hard, someone who can do both can make more money elsewhere.  If you disagree I'd be delighted to hear your case and thoughts.<p>It sounds a lot to me from this and other contributions you've made about math that you, like many others, have been damaged by some really bad teaching.  Using these techniques properly gives the child/student powerful tools for analysing situations they haven't seen before.  Teaching rote techniques doesn't - of itself - provide that power and flexibility.<p>Having said that, these ""illustratory"" techniques are often taught appallingly by well-meaning and gifted teachers who themselves have learned by rote what to do, but don't themselves have any real understanding of the math underneath.  We need teachers who are gifted teachers, but who understand the underlying principles.<p>Unfortunately, those gifted in math are rarely gifted in teached, especially teaching children.  Add to that the fact that they could earn more respect, reputation and money using the math, and what we have is a continuing disaster in math education.<p>I have no answers.",1258713481

But it is found within language features as varied as named variables, type systems, classes, constraint primitives, functional algorithms, macro systems, and domain-specific languages. You can't actually be ""declarative"" from just one of those things; it's using them in combination, in incremental layers, that gets you to a truly beautiful result.<p>I also think that the majority of programmer zealotry originates from programmers who stumble upon a paradigm that allows them to be more declarative than before; being so stricken by this new power, they become blinded to the limitations.",1258712442

952187,comment,951777.0,951874.0,0,0,theblackbox,,,"The ""why"" is a whole world of debate in and of itself, and is in fact a problem with the language used to convey scientific understanding.<p>From Wikipedia: Teleology (Greek: telos: end, purpose) is the philosophical study of design and purpose.<p>What happens is that ideas are often conveyed using teliological phrases, such as<p>""the sparrows migrate to africa in the winter month <i>so as to</i> find abundant food sources and rear the next generation..."" or \n""testicles reside outside of the body major <i>in order to</i> benefit from a reduced temperature..."".<p>The problem is that these make sense to us, although they are _very_ incorrect. The teleological concepts of ""so as"" or ""in order to"" are the whys and they are very tricky beasts. So, for utmost correctness one would prefer to say:<p>""the sparrows migrate to africa in the winter month <i>finding the</i> abundant food sources <i>needed to</i> rear the next generation..."" or \n""testicles reside outside of the body major <i>benefitting</i> from a reduced temperature...""<p>It's a very subtle issue, and one that is compounded by the popularity and ease with which we talk about biology and evolution in particular. Ernst Mayr wrote some spectacular essays on the subject, he's one of my heros so forgive me for the blatent plug! He claims that a formal understanding of the errors of telology must permeate the sciences, and most especially biology (he was a philosopher of biology), so as to clear up the ambiguities that can lead one to think there is an end or purpos (<i>telos</i>) to evolution. Even now it is still quite common for people to think of it in terms of progress and constant betterment instead of just simple and blind adaptation.",1258711397
