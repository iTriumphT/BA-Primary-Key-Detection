Then you lose man-hours that should be dedicated to your main product/services.<p>I know this because I have been working for 6 startups for 10 years. This is a very common pattern that leads to failure.",1216515035

251012,story,,,2,0,schtog,Why don't more sites use SMS as a form of payment?,,"I am playing around with Weebly now and I see they charge a small fee, only 5$ for some privileges.  \nLast.fm has also a small fee for signing up(I dont know signing up for exactly what because I can listen to the songs for free already but that irelevant for this thread).<p>So a lot of sites want to charge small fees that I find perfectly acceptable.\nI want to pay for stuff, not because I like to give my money away but I'd rather pay a little for something great then get mediocre for free.<p>The problem is they all offer payment by creditcard only. I am resistent and so is a lot of other people to giving out my creditcard to the left or right. I don't want to have several different small fees everywhere that I can't keep track of.\nIsn't there some service for that btw?<p>Anyway, if they all let me pay by SMS it would be fine. I would buy a lot more...\nAm I alone feeling like that?<p>I don't know how charging for SMS works exactly when were talking Europe to an USA-based company etc.\nMaybe it is too expensive?<p>(an old thread about SMS-services:   http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=224324\n)",1216514225

Perhaps philosophers who were important and popular 400 years ago had really bad ideas that are no longer worth thinking about. The history of mathematics is interesting, but learning how the ancient babylonians did mathematics doesn't help anyone learn category theory.",1216513937

Computers can store and process data, simulate objects, crunch numbers. They cannot explain or evaluate. These are the root of teaching and they're beyond computers' abilities.<p>My schools always had computers, and I never observed anything to suggest they aided in teaching. At best, they were labor-saving: More efficient than typewriters, more efficient than paper indices, more efficient than microfiche, etc.",1216512972

250998,comment,250930.0,250930.0,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Hegel is still studied if the philosophy department requires a historical survey of Western Philosophy. It is hard to understand the historical context of Marx, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard if you don't know anything about Hegel. Not many schools approach it this way anymore. Coursework now is more pick and choose. Medieval thought and the 19th century are the first to be ignored.<p>The reason Hegel is not taught in depth in philosophy departments anymore is because he was an intellectual fraud. In other news, medical schools no longer teach leeching or phrenology.  Consider it progress. However, if you disagree with progress, you can still get leeched from an alternative medicine quack or pick up Hegel from the literary criticism department.",1216512860

One possibile solution suggested to me by a lawyer friend would be to set up two companies: one jointly owned by you and your friend, and the other owned solely by yourself.<p>Your company would own the code you produced to date and then license it out to the jointly owned company. You could then build in an agreement where the jointly owned company has the right to purchase the code for a nominal sum at some future date if certain benchmarks are met.<p>This should give you the flexibility and protection you seem to want. You could agree to move forward with your friend as a business partner, but if he turns out to be a flop, you still have ownership over your code. At the same time, your partner should feel confident that if he performs his part, he won't be shortchanged.<p>As for the appropriate percentages, I am also currently grappling with this issue. I haven't settled on a figure yet, although I recall reading somewhere that the best deals are where both parties feel shortchanged.",1216512423
