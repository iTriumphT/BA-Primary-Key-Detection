The Spiel that white people considered black people their enemies during Apartheid is a bit incorrect (yet a popular sentiment in the west).<p>It is ironic that statistically, the plight of the majority of black people is now far worse in SA than during Apartheid (life expectancy, income inequality, unemployment, infancy mortality, matric pass rate, TIMSS score, etc…). Apartheid (i.e. separate development and rule for all ethnic and cultural groups) as an ideology is failed (mostly due to industrial development which caused South Africa to become a scrambled egg of people). Yet the ideology of full democracy (i.e. tyranny of the majority) is also spectacularly failing. Yet no one would acknowledge the latter failings.<p><\rant><p>> I'm somewhat convinced we're at the point in the US where the opposition party (either one) would sabotage the plan for short term political gain.<p>But in any case, I digress. You are right about this part. Everyone is NIMBY. The problem is also that using coal to make fuel would release CO2. And this is counter to the ideology of the far left (which only wants non-practical solutions to be implemented).<p>The USA landed people on the moon in less than a decade. I am sure that if they put their minds to it, they can expand nuclear power generation significantly (to reduce CO2) and start to make a significant part of their liquid fuel requirement from coal.",1283587184

Then, later, when you want to watch them, you can stream them from the iPad to the Apple TV. It basically turns the iPad into a pretty, portable hard disk for the TV.<p>I assume iTunes will still retain AirTunes/AirPlay/whatever as well, so your computer will also still be able to stream your ""custom, imported and re-encoded"" (i.e. pirated) media to the new Apple TV—but you'll be more likely to have brought your iPad to a friend's house than your laptop, if you didn't pre-plan watching some videos together.",1283587064

At the same time I know him to be a person of principle and I suspect those principles are some type of Chomskyan libertarianism. BTW I wonder what Chomsky would say w.r.t. this controversy.<p>Clearly you have two opposing principles.

Those are debatable positions.</i><p>Actually, I clarified what I meant in a previous post, when I characterized Perl 6 implementations as ""incomplete implementation[s] of a draft specification"". I didn't say it didn't exist, just that it exists in a non-final, pre-released state. Some people call them betas, some people call them release candidates, some people call them pre-release, and you try to cleverly evade the fact that every Perl 6 implementation is an incomplete implementation of a draft spec, but a rose by any other name and so forth.<p>I actually expect that some Perl 6 implementation will meet a finished 6.0.0 spec within the next 5 years. But none does currently. Which is a roundabout way of saying ""it's not done yet"", which is apparently doubleplusungood to state so directly.<p>I got into this trying to say good things about Perl. I guess you've shown me the error of my ways. If I'm going to have everything I say about Perl on Hacker News trolled by defensive Perl fanbois, I might as well trot out the old ""explosion in an ASCII factory"" joke again.<p>Edit: The problem is, you're seeing criticism where there was really none there. All I made was a statement of fact--Perl 6 isn't done yet. I've even clarified what I meant by ""not done yet""--the spec is draft and the implementations are incomplete even against that spec. I think that's a reasonable definition of ""not done yet"", don't you? I never said anything about how long it's taking or whether implementation and spec will ever meet, you just projected those criticisms onto me because you're defensive about the issue. That's bad faith. Fuck, man, I even said Perl 6 would be done in the near future! How the hell do you get from that to projecting ""I don't believe any implementation of Perl 6 will ever meet the 6.0.0 spec"" onto me? Are you even reading my comments or am I talking to myself here?",1283585685

And the other about someone I know and like getting kicked off a plane. And it's the story about getting kicked off the plane that gets all the upvotes.<p>[edit post downvote. I found this genuinely surprising. This Hawking piece (the full title was ""Stephen Hawking on God, Science and the Origins of the Universe"") is a beautifully simple explanation of a profound and complex topic.

I wrote my own class in PHP using curl, all data is returned in JSON which for me makes things simple. Retrieving the access token and authenticating each user can be handled a number of ways. Ever since they updated there policies, you are now allowed to store all of the users info once they allow your ""application"". I've seen alot of people complain when they use the new SDK's, but I see no reason to go that route...I think the best way whether it be a application,fan page, or external site is to present your app first, let the user actually see it and not FORCE them to allow it (which 90% of most apps do)...Once they peform a action, either redirect/ or popup/iframe to the authorization url;. I use the 'offline' permission so the access token for each user doesn't expire. Once they allow it, pull any info you want by a simple curl request, then store all there info(including access token) in your DB. Simple as that! There are only a few things I dislike, there like/comment buttons, and how you are limited to using either there iframe or xfbml (which is still an iframe).",1283584057
