This indicates to me that the sample size wasn't large enough, or at least the graph needs a higher resolution if data exists to support it.  Also, at the bottom, the article gives the numerical data, with the mean and standard deviation.  However, the mean for the hosts with high standard deviations are essentially useless, because the standard deviation is so high.  If we are going to compare average performance between cloud hosts, lets at least have useful averages to base our opinion on.",1259531962

966867,comment,966555.0,966846.0,0,0,npk,,,"The standard deviation is simply a measure of the spread of a distribution.  There's nothing wrong or right about high standard deviations.  In fact, the high standard deviation means that you should expect highly variant performance.<p>Look at the figures.  The performance of Slicehost follows a sawtooth like pattern.  The quantity standard deviation is useful because it quantifies what to expect.  Plus or minus one standard deviation means that ~ 2/3 of the time you will fall in that range.<p>If you think about the problem a little bit, you might be more worried about the standard deviation of the standard deviation.  This, in fact, would be a useful quantity, but hard to measure.<p>EDIT below this line -------\nSeveral comments below have commented that SD is somehow less useful if it's ""large"" (or large relative to the mean, or whatever).  The reason people think large SDs are indicative of a poor experiment is that in school lab classes one calculates the SD and call it the ""error"".<p>The standard deviation is a measure of spread, if it's large then the spread is large.  Knowing the spread has value.  In this case, under the parent's experimental conditions EC2's performance is more constant than that of slicehost's.<p>A fair critique of the blog posting is that the error on the standard deviation may be large, depending on the experimental conditions.  It is _not_ a fair critique to say that the SD is too high to make a prediction, you just have larger performance spread.  Note that the performance spread described is not necessarily ""error"".  The spread is inherit to either the server (as implied by the article) or the method (in which case it is an error).",1259531351

I don't know if anyone had any specific data, but there is some sort of pattern-recognition thing where you just smell that something is fishy.<p>None of this means that human-caused GW isn't a fact -- what it means is that proving it and quantifying it are turning out to be very difficult.  What the email scam shows is that people on the 'right' side of the debate (ie proponents of human-caused change) at some point went over a bit to the dark side, and decided that ""failure is not an option"" -- ends justify means, etc.<p>This saddens me because I don't want 'my' side (liberal, rational, forward-thinking) to be guilty of the same anti-science bullshit that GWB and crew were.

Read that as <i>It's got less than a 1% chance it might work, but compared to the potential gain it's still worth looking at.</i><p>ITER on the other hand has an 85+% chance of working (net energy gain) and only costs the US ~1billion.  So while ITER might cost 50x as much it's more than 50x more likely to actually work.  Also should ITER work as well as expected a working fusion reactor that could produce 1GW of base load power could be built in 10 years.  ITER's initial design was for a 500MW power plant, but ITER was scaled back to a demonstration device to lower cost and reduce risks.<p>PS: All fusion devices produce a lot a radiation and need extensive containment and decommissioning costs.  The only way you can build a 20 million$ fusion reactor is by avoiding actually producing significant amounts of fusion. So all projects that say we can demonstrate fusion for < 50 million are not going to produce significant amounts of electricity.",1259528824
