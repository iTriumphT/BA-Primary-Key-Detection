I think his comment from stackoverflow demonstrates this:<p><i>I get paid for code that works, not for tests, so my philosophy is to test as little as possible to reach a given level of confidence (I suspect this level of confidence is high compared to industry standards, but that could just be hubris). If I don't typically make a kind of mistake (like setting the wrong variables in a constructor), I don't test for it. I do tend to make sense of test errors, so I'm extra careful when I have logic with complicated conditionals. When coding on a team, I modify my strategy to carefully test code that we, collectively, tend to get wrong.</i><p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests/153565#153565"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-...</a>",1233766667

Its basically a regular python like language that has lots of built-ins for doing stuff with vectors and matrices and plotting things nicely.<p>Mathematica on the other hand is more of a tool for doing things symbolically (x's & y's).  You can integrate, differentiate, find roots, etc all symbolically.  It does have tools for doing numerical integrations and such, but they are much more of a black box than matlab's and are very hard to port out of mathematica.  Some math folks don't like mathematica because of its black-box attitude, which is understandable.  I use it sometimes for calculus.<p>Don't do linear algebra with mathematica.

465965,comment,465317.0,465585.0,0,0,Retric,,,If your testing in the code then your doing unit tests. But probably in a poor fashion.<p>Unit tests should hook into the application in such a way that you can reorder the GUI and change nothing.<p>If you are using Unit tests correctly then any change to the code base at worst requires 10% of that effort to change the test cases.  If you can think of any meaningful change that is worse then that your something is wrong with how you're testing.,1233765756

It was a comparison between 'angry' and 'calm' driving, during the angry days the driver was supposed to avoid letting people in front of them and on the calm days they were supposed to slow down and let people turn into their lane from side roads. This wasn't about fuel efficiency, it was about how much time it would cost you and quite counter-intuitively the 'calm' drivers who let multiple vehicles go in front of them actually ended up getting to work faster.<p>They also mention the ants collecting behind an ant that's carrying something. It's probably for a different reason (IE not losing the food) but it reminds me of the fleet-style of driving where they want to get vehicles to drive behind each other, sharing the same air pocket, which IIRC Mythbusters showed that tailing a big rig could reduce drag by up to 80%, however that was equivalent to being like 5 feet behind the big rig and they couldn't drive 'calm' enough at that distance and reduced efficiency, but at around 10 feet they got like a 60% drag reduction. Fleet driving (by computer) would allow vehicles to drive at 5 feet behind a big rig and get that drag reduction. However, I don't know how you'd pay for fleet-style driving because vehicles like a big rig would be improving efficiency for dozens of vehicles, which would assume nationalized transportation control so big rig drivers don't get ripped off on gas.",1233764618
