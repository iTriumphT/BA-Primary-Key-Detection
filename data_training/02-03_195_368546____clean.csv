In these places, you can count on listeners sharing some of your interests.<p>Tweaking the ranking algorithms may improve the situation, but the fact is, many of us have become complacent; we resort to throwing our content into social news forums and expecting a lot of exposure instead of doing our homework to determine who the appropriate point people are.<p>For example, if you&#x27;re trying to pitch a new web app, maybe you should forget about Hacker News and try strategically emailing / calling a few friends / colleagues.

It is competing with local businesses rather than helping support them  it&#x27;s the opposite of gentrification.<p>It&#x27;s not as if Twitter or Google provide those services via their own full time employees, right? They hire local companies to provide these services. We&#x27;re talking about catered food from local companies, apartment cleaning from a cleaning company, etc.<p>If anything, we&#x27;d expect a _greater_ level of commerce with local businesses, since employees might not choose to spend their own income on those services. By providing the services to all employees, those companies actually create more demand for local business than would probably otherwise exist.<p>The fact that they&#x27;re being provided as benefits is irrelevant - they are increasing demand.<p>The article seems to ignore this, and as a result it does not make sense to me.",1380941821

6499186,comment,6497366.0,6499155.0,6,0,bmelton,,,"> BTW, just because you&#x27;re &quot;not a Republican&quot;, it certainly \n> doesn&#x27;t mean that you&#x27;re non-partisan. Either way, you seem \n> awfully defensive for a non-Republican.<p>Mostly, I&#x27;m just sick of seeing both sides make the same talking points over and over again to see which one&#x27;s soundbites happen to stick better.  As much as you discredit Boehner for disallowing an up or down vote, Reid is doing the exactly the same thing with the memorial funding, FEMA funding, etc., etc., but the pot still calls the kettle black, and only because they&#x27;re ahead in the polls.<p>If they weren&#x27;t polling ahead, they&#x27;d have already begun the process of concession and started actually funding the government, or at least the vast majority of it, and could take the Obamacare fight separately, which is one that the House is sure to lose anyway.<p>Most of the people that I&#x27;ve seen getting upset at the Republicans about this are upset because they&#x27;re proponents of Obamacare, and most of the people I&#x27;ve seen getting upset at the Democrats are just doing so on party lines.  The House is almost perfectly divided on party lines over this, but have seen minor bi-partisan support on the individual funding bills, which the Senate refuses to entertain, only because they&#x27;re winning the popularity contest.<p>Regardless, onlookers have generally claimed their stake in the war based on the politics they already had, with both sides buying into the bullshit talking points that their elected representatives have manufactured.<p>Yes, Boehner could probably end this with a single up / down vote on a &quot;clean&quot; CR, but he&#x27;s certainly not obligated to.<p>Yes, Reid could probably end this with a few procedural votes, but he&#x27;s also not obligated to.<p>Obama could also end this by offering a little bit of non-confrontational advice to either side, but he&#x27;s not obligated to.<p>Of those, I really only criticize the Executive Branch, because I do feel that a large portion of his job is to be one of unification, for which he has failed at in his second term, and having witnessed his negotiation style with Boehner post-election, it was not one of concession.<p>The idea that the Senate should get a &quot;clean&quot; CR just because they want it is equally as farcical as the idea that the House should get a concession bill passed in which Obamacare is delayed.<p>The middle ground happens to be the area in which I think the House somewhat inadvertently stumbled into, which is the piecemeal legislation, but looking through history, that <i>is</i> the regular order on how these things tend to be organized where both wings are far apart on the &#x27;100%&#x27; solution... and the Senate refuses to entertain that.<p>If I seem nonplussed by the affair, it&#x27;s not because of any kinship with the Republicans, but because I&#x27;d personally like to see our government be less efficient, as I suspect very heavily that is what our founders would prefer.  A slow moving government is in the best interests of liberty, and I&#x27;d much rather see bills take far longer to hash out than to have trillions of dollars in spending or taxes approved with an uncontested procedural vote.<p>Edit: And I had to add this, but thinking I&#x27;m a member of the opposition party because I&#x27;m not in 100% agreement with your party does nothing but affirm my pessimism about thoughtful politics in the US.  Not that you should care, per se, but there are people out there who try to reason their way into the intelligent side of any issue, without bothering to check and see which way they&#x27;re &quot;supposed&quot; to feel based on party lines.  That isn&#x27;t an accusation to you, or anybody here, so much as a signal that both sides are wrong about as much as they&#x27;re right, and we shouldn&#x27;t feel &quot;loyalty&quot; to politicians that we like enough that we should support them when they&#x27;re wrong, and vice versa.",1380941613

That is, &quot;the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse, blah, blah, blah&quot;.<p>The bottom line is that the action of shutting down the government as a means of forcing a <i>completely unrelated</i> concession from the White House/Senate is just plain wrong and damn near extortionate. They put the ACA to a vote 43 times since its passage and couldn&#x27;t do anything with it. You really think it&#x27;s healthy Constitutional politics to then subvert that expression of the people&#x27;s will by inflicting harm on the entire country unless they meet your demands?<p>But, if you want to pull out the Constitution, then cool: let Mr. Boehner put it to an up-down vote so that the will of <i>all</i> of the people can be expressed via their elected representatives. But, what is this handful of people shutting down the government nonsense?<p>The past five years have nothing to do with this. Both parties are not at fault. Both houses are not at fault. A small minority of Republicans and a gutless Speaker are at fault. Period. Anything else is just a cynical red herring. Discussing the merits of the ACA in the context of the shutdown simply indicates that you&#x27;re either following the red herring or dragging it.<p>BTW, yes, I voted for Obama and have had mixed feelings on his performance.

If NSA comes carrying gifts, it warrant being very careful in accepting them from a party with such hostile priorities.<p>Well, not really.<p>The &quot;tinfoil&quot; idea is that NSA is breaking into crypto so that they can blackmail politicians, black-bag innocent citizens, etc.<p>But it was <i>never</i> widely assumed that NSA wasn&#x27;t trying to break every bit of encryption they could. Besides the fact that such activities are <i>literally their job</i>, it&#x27;s one of the few things they&#x27;d just as likely tell you directly if you asked them.<p>&quot;Q: Are you trying to break cipher/cryptosystem FOO?&quot; &quot;A: Yes, we&#x27;re trying to break all of them, to protect our SIGINT capability&quot;.<p>NSA has spent literally decades analyzing and breaking the military-grade ciphers of other nations. So I don&#x27;t know where people got the idea that just because civilians obtained access to military-grade encryption, that NSA would suddenly stop with cryptanalysis efforts. But it has nothing to do with civilians per se; the military and national security opponents are using our civilian crypto too!<p>Is that inconvenient for civilian cryptography? Sure. But let&#x27;s not act like people are having something chipped and taken away from them, that they&#x27;ve always had.<p>Before RSA and DH there was essentially <i>no</i> widely-known safe cryptosystems that we could use. You used DES, or you could make up your own Vigenre implementation perhaps (have fun with key exchange!).<p>And that&#x27;s just discussing computer communications. Your phones were all tappable, international telegrams easily read if it suited NSA, and good luck if you used one of those new-fangled cell phones.<p>The claimed threat is that computers make NSA more capable of surveilling the people at large, but the evidence shows that systems like Tor are putting up an exceptional fight, and even cryptosystems like TLS with many known weaknesses mostly work against global passive surveillance.<p>You would have to get on NSA&#x27;s specific shitlist to have to really worry, but being on that shitlist 20 years ago meant <i>anything</i> you said <i>would</i> be picked up... and now, even that is not so certain.",1380939665
