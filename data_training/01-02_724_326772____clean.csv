Now I'm older and jaded I don't know if that makes me wiser or stupider.<p>In school, you can actually ace every course. In fact, it's structured so that if you have a good work ethic, above-average talent, and a little bit of luck, getting a 4.00 GPA is possible. It's not easy (I didn't) but certainly within striking distance.<p>In the ""real world"" of work, you can't actually ace everything and please everyone while developing your career at the same time. It's not humanly possible to do everything that you ""should"" do. If you're trying to do five different things, you're probably doing none of them well. If you're trying to ""be the best cog you can be"", you won't have any energy left for the side projects that might lead to liberation from your boring corporate job. That might be the right approach; maybe your boring corporate job is one rung below a very interesting job in the same company. (Not all corporate jobs suck.) It might not be. But you have to pick and choose. What are you going to do a great job of, what are you going to get by on ""good enough"", and what can you cut (perhaps an unfruitful side project) for the time being?<p>Being ""the best cog in the machine"" doesn't provide much reward over being a marginally acceptable cog. You might get a 8% raise instead of 5%. Big whoop; not worth the extra hours and sweat. On the other hand, if someone in the company (possibly your manager, possibly someone else) decides to take you on in a mentor/protege role and look out for your career, then it makes sense for you to put your all into that work.<p>In school, you can get the sense that hard work is always rewarding and virtuous. In real life, sometimes hard work is just wasted effort. You have to discriminate.<p>What is very unpleasant is dealing with the aftermath of people who took ""working strategically"" too far and edged into the unethical: people who wrote garbage code fast, were promoted away from maintenance, and left an albatross for their juniors. That happens a lot in software. It sucks.",1318211755

3091949,comment,3090844.0,3091799.0,3,0,feral,,,"But what is 'actual business value'?\nLets say we are considering an oil company, which makes a profit from drilling oil.  If oil rises in price, the company makes more profit. Surely, in a very real sense, the 'actual business value' of this company, depends on the price of oil?<p>Lets talk about PepsiCo.\nThe weather service detects a new hurricane forming off the coast of Florida, sending orange juice futures up.\nAt some discrete point in time, the weather forecast computer model spits out its results, and that information is on its way to becoming public, and there's going to be a fast change in the price of oranges, and hence the value of PepsiCo.<p>Here is an article, describing just such an event:<p>""\nOrange juice futures hit a three-year high on Tuesday as speculators eyed the development of a Caribbean storm that meteorologists said had a chance of moving towards Florida.\nOrange juice is a $20bn industry with prices affecting farmers in Florida and Brazil, processors, trading houses and bottlers such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.\n""\n<a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1831a65c-c5a8-11df-ab48-00144feab49a.html#axzz1aL68Vqqf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1831a65c-c5a8-11df-ab48-00144...</a><p>Now, lets look at Google.  Lets say Google does better in a more buoyant economy, because they get more ads (maybe the opposite happens in real life; but its just an example). And the drop in the price of oil has given me information that others think the economy is tanking. Hasn't the 'actual business value' of Google changed, in a very real sense?  And quickly?<p>You might argue, if you believed in a deterministic universe, that the value of Google hasn't changed - the economy was <i>always</i> going to tank, because the universe only plays out one way.  But that's irrelevant, because we don't have access to such a model of the universe.  What we have to make decisions on is the information we have access to, which can change suddenly, and which the markets do a good job of aggregating.<p>I'm not trying to argue for front running the trades in the market or anything like that. I'm just trying to argue that business value can change rapidly.<p>I think the reason prices change so quickly is because aggregated belief about the value of companies changes so quickly, and because our markets allow that change in aggregated belief to be quickly expressed.<p>If you slowed trading down, so that it happened hourly, as you might propose, what this would mean is that the price of PepsiCo is essentially out-of-date for an hour.  I could no longer look at the price of PepsiCo on the market, and assume it was doing a reasonable job of aggregating the public information about the future prospects of PepsiCo - I'd have to imagine it was an hour out of date.\nThis would probably make the market less useful.",1318211731

To date, Samsung's response has been weakened because the patents they've been asserting have generally been ones Samsung has agreed to license as essential technology they've contributed to various mobile standards. Apple has made the apparently odd mistake of not actually licensing the patents in question (I'd have thought that would have been part of the pre-lawsuit due diligence), but while Samsung might play some games on the price of licensing, they aren't in a position to refuse to license them entirely.<p>The new patents would be a very different kettle of fish. Using two antennas is pretty clearly not essential technology (plenty of phones don't), so Samsung would have a direct line of attack on the iPhone 4S. And since Apple has demonstrated exactly how to get preliminary injunctions to keep your competitors off of the market, it could get very interesting.",1318211149

It is to do what your manager or what your manager's manager wants you to do. Listen to what they want and fulfil it as well as possible. If you are going to be a cog in a machine, then you strive to be the best cog in the machine you're going to be! If not, then read below.<p>This isn't a job you like. You're in debt so you need the job. First thing you do would then be remove the debt! In a mortgage? Move out and lease the house or sell it and rent, which ever saves more money. Don't go out every week, go out every month. Delay that macbook pro upgrade for another year. See a big discount on shoes? Buy a couple, but don't wear them yet. Eat the generic brand cereal. Cook yourself, don't eat out. If you don't have time, eat only fruit, vegetables and rice. They are cheap and easy to prepare. If you're going to save money, you do it the best you can. Once you get out of debt and getting some savings, you can refocus on getting another job. If many companies deal with legacy shit, then focus on getting a job at Apple. :)<p>So you don't really want to start another career at 45. Plus you have kids to take care of. You're a father/mother after all. Ahh, so you're a parent, and you rather spend time with your kids. Then spend your time with your kids!

These Wall Street protests have no real objective except for expressing anger at the current economic situation.<p>It's ironic in my opinion because most of these people have 1080p televisions, iPhones, cars, shelter, Internet, and an indefinite supply of food. We don't have oppressive dictators suppressing our freedoms like in Egypt and Libya. I mean obviously things could be improved with more people employed, but their anger seems disproportional and misdirected. It amuses me to think that even if employment levels become good again, 10 years down the road people will become angry for whatever reason. Nothing is ever good enough, and the grass is always greener.<p>On your second point, I also agree that they have no place here, although this link doesn't have a political agenda.

The major difference was that Bobba was aimed for mobile but it's hard not to see similarities.

Its claims are completely delusional.  Among them:<p># How Tim gained 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days, without steroids, and in four hours of total gym time<p># How to sleep 2 hours per day and feel fully rested<p># How to triple testosterone and double sperm count<p># How to go from running 5 kilometers to 50 kilometers in 12 weeks<p># How to reverse ""permanent"" injuries<p>This kind of stuff only fools people who don't have prior information to compare it to.  For example, the ""incredibly high"" level of testosterone he is talking about is in the 600 ng/dL range, which is a <i>normal</i> level.  It is an <i>expected</i> number, and the variation he observes is completely within the range of natural fluctuations.  Testosterone peaks and falls.<p>It is also impossible to gain 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days with that level of testosterone.  In fact, it would be impossible for anyone other than a professional bodybuilder coming back from a layoff (it's quicker to regain if you've already achieved it before) WITH high doses of anabolic agents including testosterone, pushing massive weights.<p>(Injectable testosterone esters have long carbon tails which means the molecules take much longer to be broken down.  This jacks up testosterone levels 24 hours a day, without the peak/fall of the normal cycle.  This vastly increases the window for protein synthesis.)<p>Just look at the claim: 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days, which is over a pound a day, in <i>less than 4 hours</i> in the gym.  This is almost 9 POUNDS OF MUSCLE per one hour of exercise.  Completely ludicrous.<p>Sleeping 2 hours a day?  Sure.  Forget 8-minute abs, we've got... 7 minute abs!<p>Being able to run 30 miles after 3 months of training?  Are we onto this BS yet?<p>Those injuries you've got, they aren't ""permanent""!

Just look at all the publicity for it -- it was a CONSTANT media blitz where Ferriss was working around-the-clock to promote himself.  And he's been doing that for a long time; his self-promotion is a full-time job in itself.<p>It's the same old story with <i>all</i> the so-called financial gurus.  They ALL get rich by selling <i>you</i> a book about how you can get rich quickly and with barely any work.<p>Anyone who's ever done any programming or writing knows how little 4 hours is.  As a weekly investment, that is NOT the path to mastery or startup success.<p>You can't even be a successful snake-oil salesman with 4 hours per week, as evidenced by Ferriss himself.

It created amputees, homeless vets, PTSD, etc.<p>The public's distaste for war was not of a moral nature, it was a byproduct of an increasing standard of living.  Life was easier, people saw less suffering and death, expected more from life, etc.<p>As with the space program, America's worship of technology could be leveraged to build super weapons... but only if those weapons led to ""hygienic"" war in which Americans didn't have to see the horrors firsthand.<p>So our defense contractors built smart bombs, highly accurate missiles, etc.  UAVs are just the next step.<p>The future holds both precision insect-size (or smaller) attack robots, as well as massive space-based lasers (the death star was uncannily prescient) aimed at earth and able to vaporize nearly anything that isn't heavily armed.<p>All of this will be controlled by a smaller and smaller class of military personnel. Gone will be the days of recruiting welfare recipients to enlist.<p>The debacle over ""Star Wars"" as envisioned by Reagan was mostly b/c the technology wasn't mature enough at the time.  But just as George W. Bush jumped at the chance to wage two large wars (b/c the public momentarily would consent) there will come another moment for space based lasers, and we can be sure that our planners will not let that opportunity go to waste.<p>The recent stories about the drone fleet being pwned, followed by the stories about the Chinese building drones, are designed to get the average person to say ""Darn it we need America to be a leader in Drone tech, let's spare no expense to have the very best"".<p>Nowhere in the trajectory toward space based lasers and assassination drones is any moral concern likely to emerge.  Why? Because when war is hygienic nobody realizes that it's ugly and worthy of moral reasoning.  The discussion becomes about the merits of one technology vs another, one nation's tech vs another, not about what horrific purposes these devices will actually be used for.<p>So your point is well taken.

Aesthetic completion, perhaps? I would personally much rather work in that way as well: always able to take the time to write great code, never having to do deal with legacy bullshit or ill-considered external demands that compromise the quality. But is that practical? Not for most people. Steve Jobs could pull it off. He was rich and didn't need to keep his job at Apple (one that he'd already lost in '85) so he could actually do great work, and insist on the same from others.<p>The strategic approach is to pretty much stop at ""good enough"" and move on to something else. That's what most people do at work, and I don't like it but I understand why people work that way.
