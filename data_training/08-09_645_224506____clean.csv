It&#x27;s extraordinarily dangerous to build <i>any</i> strong AI (or optimization process) with a value function less general than one that will best satisfy the value functions of sapient beings.  (Side note: that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean we need to build the AI to itself be sapient; I&#x27;ve seen the term &quot;optimization process&quot; used as a substitute for AI, to imply that it need not have any agency of its own, only a goal to satisfy people&#x27;s goals.)  Any strong AI that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> specifically value &quot;people&quot; will hurt people as a side effect of maximizing whatever it <i>does</i> value.<p>>> &quot;There is no plausible scenario in which we build a strong AI... and it doesn&#x27;t take over the world&quot;<p>> First off you are using polemic here with the &quot;plausible&quot; card<p>I very specifically mentioned &quot;strong AI&quot;: AI capable of self-improvement to better satisfy some value function.  We could quibble over the word &quot;capable&quot;, but I&#x27;d argue that a computer with the capability of self-improvement that specifically chooses not to do so seems rather pointless; why build the capability if not to use it?<p>> There are in fact no proofs that a strong AI will take over<p>I used &quot;take over&quot; very loosely there.  A strong AI will self-improve to maximize its value function, whatever that value function is.  Most interesting value functions tend to benefit from more resources.  Even seemingly trivial value functions can potentially blow up if the system decides it could benefit by expanding the amount of computational capacity it has available; more computational capacity requires more hardware, which requires more matter; you&#x27;re made of matter, and that matter isn&#x27;t currently being used optimally to maximize the value function.<p>> Additionally there is no indication that &quot;intelligence&quot; beyond human level is at all possible.<p>In which case my statement is vacuously true. :)",1451120098

10793690,comment,10765076.0,10766775.0,0,0,_ph_,,,"> That&#x27;s not the GPL&#x27;s fault, proven by the fact that there are commercial software companies that sell GPL software.<p>You cannot &quot;sell&quot; GPL software. You can provide it as a service (one time fee, the customer can reuse it without additional payments) or just charge service fees. But for most commercial software the development costs can be financed only if you have the traditional selling model, it would not exist otherwise.<p>> There are reasons to not use GPL, but you don&#x27;t want to follow the community&#x27;s rules, you don&#x27;t get to steal their work. Nothing is free; either pay the price the community sets (follow the GPL), or negotiate another license from the authors.<p>No one talked about stealing. I very careful observe the license of any software I touch - this is exactly the reason GPL makes me sad. I can&#x27;t touch it, I have to treat the software as if it not existed. With the software I can use, I often can enhance it on paid time and donate back, but there is just no way of doing so with GPL software.<p>> Yes, they prefer being able to take code for free without any ethical obligation to give back, a very narcissistic attitude. This meme that the GPL is &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;less-free&quot; is just a cheap excuse to try to get free code.<p>You got it exactly backwards. Developers at companies are very aware of the ethical obligation to give back and usually are able to do so - LGPL is mostly fine for this reason. But GPL requires them to open source something else too, and that is where the conflict arrives. The GPL license does not only involve the software it is on, but it also tries to affect others people software.<p>I think every developer has the freedom to choose any license she or he wants and the license should be observed. I have seen good software pass away, because the developer was not willing to share it at all, and there is good software which does not get used, because the license terms prevent it. So I can only hope every developer chooses the license carefully, and as discussed GPL basically excludes the software from commercial environments. If thats what the author wants, fine. But it needs to be considered.",1451119867

10793687,comment,10793569.0,10793569.0,0,0,Ultimatt,,,"The one where you don&#x27;t think of a degree as an intellectual commodity, and instead realise the intellectual returns come from yourself and your own work. You could do an English degree in the worst university and still come out knowing higher Maths. Anyone doing just the set work from lectures hoping for a quick intellectuql fix completely misses the finer points of going to university. It&#x27;s an environment of self learning. If you bury yourself in that and dedicate your time to learning whatever you want, any degree and any university is equally worthwhile. Some it&#x27;s just a more pleasant experience to do that, given what you want to put in and get out. Chemistry for example is a lot better provided for at rich universities. Making contacts in the world of academia if you wish to begin an academic career is one of the few other reasons to choose a specific degree and location. If you aren&#x27;t interested in academia,  choice of university and course is a lot more irrelevant... other than prestige and tuition fees. Unless you plan on getting in to the most prestigious univsersity in the land an employer wont care too much. A vocational degree title like &quot;Software Engineer&quot; matters more for many jobs. Even if what you learnt far outstrips that role, or you avoided learning half of what is necessary to be any use. Ultimately the best degree with highest return will fit your interests and life goals enabling you to engage with self learning, no one can tell you what that is, or suggest it without a lot more info. For me I did three different degrees in three different subjects at two different universities. There wasnt method to the madness ibfollowed my interests. Now I work in a job that uses a broad set of my skills I otherwise couldnt have done with the time only learning a single subject. I managed to jump degree subjects through learning a lot of foundational knowledge for the next during the time of whatever course I was working through. It didnt feel like hard work because I was having too much fun learning new stuff, and interacting with cool people along the way. Once you live for learning any university dept becomes a great environment, but any prescriptive degree course is highly limiting to your intellectual return. Engage with learning and thebuni environment not with course soecifics, treat modules like a box ticking exercise, the minimum knowledge in areas others identified as important to learn.",1451119603

What I think should happen (so of course it won&#x27;t) is for players to only get paid their absurdly high salaries for the games they win. Lose and only get league minimum. This would give players an incentive to play hard each and every game. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot wrong with that idea, and I haven&#x27;t really though it through.<p>I don&#x27;t think that sort of salary structure would work quite as readily in the NFL. There&#x27;s much less guaranteed money, and marginal players are always getting cut. So most on an NFL team do play pretty hard. Also coaching decisions affect football far more than basketball. Suck for Luck is more on management than on the players. How do you disincentivise management from doing that?<p>And, every so often in the NFL, an Albert Haynesworth comes along and stops playing after getting a lot of guaranteed money. But that&#x27;s mostly owner stupidity at work. Probably a little of that going on this year with Ndamukong Suh. Certainly a lot lot more of that going on in baseball and basketball with their ridiculously high guaranteed contracts.",1451119476

I don&#x27;t want to learn Nix, I want to use Ruby.<p>Actually, that would have been really handy about 5 years ago, but the point stands: the problem with general tools like Nix is that you need a popular, specific application of them to get them across the chasm.  Not only would a wrapper script using Nix to manage ruby versions be actually useful, it ought to be relatively easy to repurpose to node, elixir, elm, GHC, whatever.
