And if there is an impending &quot;Hiring Freeze&quot; that is about to be enforced , the desperation to hire someone goes up. This happens in large companies ( I m not sure about startups though); In these cases - the hiring Managers feel its OK for a candidate fall short of a bunch of expectations . They might as well have a resource that can get some work done , instead of not hiring any one ( and be stuck with one less resource for the next few months) . Most of the hiring freezes last one quarter. Sometimes , it might last two quarters - and it mounts a lot of pressure on the existing members of the team.<p>(2) Hiring managers (sometimes) look for potential than what you are currently capable of. You might have not the exact skills they are looking for - but you might have shown enough enthusiasm about the role / and might have strong indicators that you could get the job done for them.<p>Its fairly possible either one of these or both could be happening in your case.",1427010817

9245977,comment,9244283.0,9245855.0,0,0,saraid216,,,"> (I really hate the phrase &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;, by the way, because it simply isn&#x27;t a good way to describe democratic voting, where the majority is emergent and not determined ex ante.)<p>Nothing about the phrase actually requires the tyranny be remotely permanent, and nothing about the concept of tyranny requires it either. Indeed, it&#x27;s actually more poignant that the tyranny is both ephemeral and, more importantly, inevitable. This is the real issue. It&#x27;s easy to comprehend the issue by looking at semi-permanent states [1], like Marxist class divisions or political polarization, but those are <i>consequences</i>.<p>When you place something to a vote and fail to achieve consensus, you have a majority whose will is being enacted upon a minority. This is commonly celebrated by moronic catchphrases such as, &quot;the right side of history,&quot; but you still have a winner and a loser. And when the ephemeral majority seems to crystallize from the aether into an unmistakable demographic of some kind, you really have to wonder about this &quot;emergent majority&quot; concept.<p>The fundamental American problem is that it is incapable of trusting its government. (I can&#x27;t speak to other governments; I don&#x27;t live under those.) This lack of trust is well-founded, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less crippling. I said below that the appropriate counter to the tyrannical majority is a strong executive. The executive is capable of saying, &quot;No,&quot; to a popular opinion in a way that the legislature cannot. (Indeed, this is a role Americans have shoved onto the judiciary, which means we can&#x27;t actually say no until someone files a lawsuit.) The interplay between the legislature and the executive (the vote, the veto, the super-majority overrule, the refusal to enforce, the impeachment) is exactly the solution being proposed.<p>None of it works without an executive willing to exercise its options. See Obama&#x27;s refusal to enforce immigration laws, for instance. (For the sake of this &quot;academic debate&quot;, let&#x27;s presume that he could enforce them to the letter if he wanted to.) That is a check against tyranny of the majority. So naturally, well... see for yourself [2]. This isn&#x27;t meant as an anti-Republican statement; it&#x27;s just the most recent example I could bring to mind off the top of my head.<p>The trust part comes back when you ask, &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t a minority group tyrannized by a majority group just leave?&quot; You know, secede. This comes back to the emergent majority you spoke of: if you trust the majority to, you know, not be dicks about it [3]. To not <i>always</i> be the majority, then secession isn&#x27;t necessary. You can expect that the issues will change and you&#x27;ll be in the majority. Of course, what&#x27;s happened with the polarized political class in America is that you stick around because you figure you can <i>win</i> next time.<p>This is a problem. It is the exact opposite of what you need to make sure that a majority is an emergent majority. Instead of melting back into an indeterminate goo and forming new majority/minority groups in each vote, you have battle lines being drawn for a budding civil war. And that&#x27;s as far as I&#x27;ve figured out.<p>[1] &quot;State&quot; as in &quot;state of being&quot;, not as in &quot;nation-state&quot;.

Because this is aimed at mobile developers, unreliable latency will be a major factor.

Maybe it&#x27;s specifically the density of people in passenger jets that causes issues, but you&#x27;d think the military would have done studies about smoke in airplanes prior to the 80&#x27;s.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting how much catastrophe investigation resembles bug hunting.  The crash had four distinct features that made it such a disaster:<p>- A internal piece of the engine, a combustor can, had a crack manually repaired via welding.  Since the documentation to the mechanic didn&#x27;t specify the <i>maximum</i> crack length that could be repaired, the weld was insufficient.<p>- The combustor can exploded during takeoff, which broke through the wing&#x27;s fuel line<p>- The engine lit the leaking fuel line on fire<p>- The fire caught a wind updraft, which engulfed the (otherwise fire-retardant) fuselage, causing poisonous smoke to fill the cabin in minutes.<p>If any one of the 4 issues hadn&#x27;t occurred, catastrophe could have been avoided.  Piecing all that together really gives new meaning to the term &quot;cascading escalating failure&quot;.<p>Finally, the video mentioned how one door got stuck because the inflatable ramp failed to deploy.  On modern aircraft, those ramps are no joke.  If you&#x27;ve ever heard &quot;Cross-check and verify&quot; on a flight, it means to verify that the ramps (which explosively inflate) are activated [1].  The &#x27;red strip&#x27; on a flight door means that opening said door with trigger the ramp.  These things are pretty powerful and can be dangerous in their own right, if opened in the wrong situation [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-do-all-the-controls-in-an-airplanes-cockpit-do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-do-all-the-controls-in-an-airplane...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/06/30/326919223/emergency-slide-deploys-inside-u-s-jetliner-forcing-a-landing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/06/30/326919223/eme...</a>",1427009604

It&#x27;s hard to say which jhanic states exactly because I practice alone with no teachers. I would guess from first to third but not for long periods of time. I have experienced piti and after that entered &#x27;equanimity&#x27; jhanic state, subtle but alert and content concentration.<p>I highly recommend the book Focused and Fearless, I haven&#x27;t seen such clarity on meditation anywhere else, except maybe Buddhist texts but they can be cryptic and poorly translated.<p>My technique is comfortable freestyle sitting (as opposite to lotus that gives me pain and takes away from concentration) and breath counting from 1 to 10 and 10 to 1 until I reach more relaxed breathing, then I switch to counting 1-1 on inhale, 1-1 on exhale, repeat until 10 and backwards, this reduced mental activity and keeps me on a) breath at nostrils and b) concentration with counting. After 15-20 minutes I usually start hitting Jhanic states with piti coming in first and then going away to enter more subtle higher absorption.<p>But yeah, get the above book, I am not much of a guide, I was actually lucky to hit piti within several days of Anapanasati meditation and Jhanic states within a week.

One of the challenges in reading a new literature is in learning what set of citations are commonly reused and how, especially because the conventionalized citation of a paper isn&#x27;t necessarily what the author expected it to be known for, nor what you might take from a paper on a first reading (or any number of readings). For this reason I highly recommend reading papers with inline full citations (Chomsky, 1965) rather than numeric/ indexical citations that you have to look up [1].<p>Finally, mock-reviewing a paper is a fantastic way to make sure you&#x27;re being honest about how much of the paper you understand. Another technique at higher grad school levels is mock-reviewing a paper from someone else&#x27;s (=prominent academic&#x27;s) perspective--which imposes the dual constraint of understanding the paper at hand as well as the theoretical perspective behind someone else&#x27;s critique.",1427008741
