Most people would just use the free version, but as IconFactory proved there are plenty of people out there who'd support the app by purchasing a premium blend.",1222605032

Apparently you are doing fine without a business plan, so why let a VC force you to use one? What other things will they force you to do that are not really aligned with your preferences and that will only suck away your energy and time?<p>Isn't there another option: tell the VCs that sure, you can present to them, but that you don't have a business plan?<p>Creating a business plan just for them would also be an upfront investment on your part.
