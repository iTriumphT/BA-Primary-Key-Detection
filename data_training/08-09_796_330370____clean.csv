If there are no other textbooks / papers / patents were this phrase is used, this seems like a pretty strong indicator to me. A search on Google Scholar for that exact phrase gives (at the time) the two expected results. <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22computationally+impractical+to+reverse%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22computationally...</a><p>Alternative hypothesis: (a) Nakamoto paid close attention to research, read the patent and liked the phrase. (b) The phrase is common lingo, but Google Scholar doesn&#x27;t index it. For example, it could be used in a private mailing list. Both (a) and (b) seems like they could quite easily be investigated by someone with domain knowledge together with some knowledge of how patents are distributed.<p>This seems like too simplistic a reasoning. Anyone care to explain what I am missing?<p>EDIT: The exact phrase &quot;computationally impractical&quot; seems to be very common, with thousands of citations before 2008 <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22computationally+impractical%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&as_ylo=&as_yhi=2008"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22computationally+impra...</a> It seems to me that reversibility might simple have been a &quot;theme&quot; in crypto circles around that time, which could explain the coincidence that two different groups independently glued the phrases together.",1383209642

A while (10 years I think) ago I made a lot of money by &#x27;accident&#x27; by replacing my ads with affiliate offers on a very busy site I had. I had no clue what affiliate marketing was or how it worked; I read a spam email by a company doing it and it sounded like  it was worth a try. It worked; it converted like mad and my income from this side project rocketed. The company invited me to one of these vacation things on a ship; the people I met there... I like the affiliate concept but indeed a lot of companies and people involved are just borderline criminals. I also noticed that most of them just know nothing; they accidentally rolled into this and it worked for them, but they don&#x27;t know business (the money tap is just on or off; most of them don&#x27;t do bookkeeping or pay tax) or anything outside &#x27;Must Make Money Easily&#x27;.

The policy can be different, based on the userbase and the tools being used, but limiting the mechanism to disallow bad policies is wrong.<p>While you can create a page-long listing of filename troubles, in practice <i>these shell users</i> only end up having to account for filenames with spaces in them. Occasionally you have to <i>rm --</i> an accidentally created file. Nobody uses those crazy filenames with leading and trailing space, escape codes, and newline characters because it means trouble with the shell. So the problem kind of takes care of itself.<p>But there might be some future user interface that doesn&#x27;t have the escaping and expansion problems of current shells and with that it might be useful to be able to put nearly any character into filenames. The Linux/Unix kernel isn&#x27;t in the position to dictate how the filenames shall be used. It only needs the path separator and NUL terminator and not caring about anything else means less kernel code that can break.",1383209582

But I&#x27;ve never seen a human make filenames with a leading hyphen (plenty with hyphen within the word) nor with a newline.<p>I could imagine that somewhere there is a person or two that likes to make hyphen-led filenames to try and sort things, but this is catering to the outliers. I can&#x27;t imagine the use case for anyone to intentionally make a filename with a newline in it, and haven&#x27;t seen such a thing, human or program-made.

(StreetView and consistent street-level addressing are the two main points in its favour.)<p>For the other 70%, you will build something better by working with the raw map data (which usually means PostGIS) and using custom cartography (which could mean a lot of things, but let&#x27;s say TileMill+OpenStreetMap).<p>This greatly swings the balance back towards Ruby or Python. FWIW I don&#x27;t generally use Rails, preferring a custom Rack+DataMapper stack, but the same point holds. The amount of smart geo stuff you can do in one line of code with a PostGIS-friendly ORM is astonishing.<p>More broadly, your article says &quot;technology A is better than technology B because C&quot;. That&#x27;s cool. And here I am, posting a comment that says technology D (custom geo) is better than technology E (GMaps) because F. No doubt there are also arguments G, H, and so on. Your C is essentially a productivity argument - do the same thing faster. That&#x27;s important, yes, but deeply personal (I find it difficult to believe I&#x27;d ever be as productive in JS as Ruby, and I&#x27;m not entirely a JS n00b).

Maybe not], but even an authoritarian reading of Marx ideological works fits within utilitarian principles to those who agree with it, while those who read Marx from a libertarian viewpoint, e.g. left communists, would generally find Mills distastefully authoritarian.<p>Locke was a major investor in the slave trade, and a central participant in trying to institute a feudal aristocracy in Carolina - writing about freedoms while trying to deprive others of them. Locke Mail in that respect would be fitting brand for a NSA run mail service for its hypocrisy alone.<p>Hobbes, while talking about individual rights, was a supporter of a strong central government an a supporter of absolute monarchy. He too would be a suitable beacon for the NSA.<p>That is not to say that these people were not important for the development of philosophical ideas related to freedom, but only in relation to the politics of the time.

I definitely see secure email starting as a niche and if the user experience is at least as good as gmail I don&#x27;t see any reason why a new email system would not take over.<p>It&#x27;s not going to happen overnight but there definitely is a need for it. Lavabit and Silent Circle are proofs that this need is real.<p>There are major issues with replacing the current email:<p>1) there is no good open source email interface (if I&#x27;m wrong, please point me to this gem). Roundcube is good but not good enough when you come from gmail. I don&#x27;t know of anything better than roundcube.<p>2) the threshold for a company to implement secure email is too high. Having a secure standard with secure libraries certainly lower that threshold<p>3) the current open source mails are GPL like licenses. This sucks for companies and individuals. Give them the ability to do what they want, including money. Replacing email is not going to happen without investment. Technology investments are mainly done by companies, only exceptionally by individuals.<p>Anyway, if anyone wants to take a shot as implementing an easy to use & opinionated (ie standardisation vs customization) webmail, chime in: <a href=""https://github.com/nherment/dolphyn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nherment/dolphyn</a><p>(edit: form & typos)",1383208655

It has plenty of features for achieving the same goals--say modularity--but there is no 1:1 mapping between those features and Ruby features. Or any OOP features at all.<p>Basically, you can do the same things but not necessarily in the same ways. For example, Haskell does not have any inheritance the way OO languages do, so that simply doesn&#x27;t come up. This doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s less capable--it just means it&#x27;s different. Very different.<p>One example is interfaces: in Haskell, depending on the context, you might use the module system, typeclasses or even just normal types to accomplish the same things as an OOP interface. You can still organize your code in a similar way, but the actual mechanics are different. In fact, since Haskell allows you to explicitly control effects, you have <i>more</i> organizational power!<p>I hope this clears things up. Ultimately, the details of how you can organize things is going to vary per use case. Perhaps the easiest thing to do is just to pick up basic Haskell and see what larger Haskell programs look like.",1383208221
