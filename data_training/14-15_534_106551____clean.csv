I reserve Forbidden for cases where the client needs to authenticate.<p>EDIT: Actually, I see that the spec says that authentication should do nothing to fix a Forbidden error, so you might be right. Unauthorized is for authentication.<p>Perhaps this is what buro9 means about overloading error codes, but the rest map so cleanly on the errors that it's hard to ignore them. You can't very well return 200 and say ""There was error X"" in the response.<p>Maybe we should use 418?",1312642786

The rest just flows.<p>The current iteration of the tooling with EF4.1 and nuget is a good improvement.<p>Some of your questions:<p>> Is it the cost?<p>Windows servers, Visual studio licences and some SQL server licences can add up. Some small startups couldn't afford it, but MS will ""make the first one free"" with bizspark. Big companies won't sweat it.<p>> Performance issues?<p>Nope, asp mvc is quite performant. That's one thing that's easier in a compiled, strongly typed language.<p>> Frustrating development environment?<p>Nope. VS2010 with resharper, nuget and nunit is sweet. As long as you have enough memory.<p>> Lack of a Hacker community?<p>Not completely lacking, but may be smaller than with other environments. But there should be user groups, conferences, etc. It may depend on where you are.<p>There are lots of resources for you to read, official docs on msdn, stackoverflow, blogs, and .net geeks on twitter, etc.",1312642678

Google would have required these patents, not because it wanted to build products relating to them but because they can be used to defend against other companies when they bring lawsuits on Google.

So, it will take at least 2 months to get clarity. Start looking for jobs through your professional network (build one if you don't have one), and start looking for a good immigration lawyer.

As soon as there is the slightest hint of fear of bankruptcy, everyone hoards cash, no one can repay loans, and thousands of banks go bankrupt.  See for reference every single recession and depression before the creation of the FDIC.<p>The only reason fractional reserve works now is because there is an FDIC and Federal Reserve who will create new money any time there is excessive demand for people to convert deposits into cash.  Fractional reserve only works because of the fiat powers of the government.  So my point stands - if you assume the U.S. is using its fiat powers, then the debt is AAA.  If you assume the U.S. is not using its fiat powers, then the U.S. should have the debt rating of an over-leveraged, 1929 private bank - ie, extremely low.<p><i>Did you just call the entirety of Standard & Poor's, a leading financial firm for over 150 years, extraordinarily ignorant?</i><p>Yes I did.

You either buy my arguments or you don't.  If you're not willing to use your own reason, and base your views entirely on appeals to authority, then there really is not any point in further discussion.<p>If you wish to see my arguments laid out in further detail, I do have a blog.
