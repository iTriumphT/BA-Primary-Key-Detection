Method:,,,
Partition coefficient (log P) were estimated from the difference in solvation free energies of solute in neutral state in water and 1-octanol at infinite dilution.,,,
"For hydration, a simulation box size of 32 A was used (1111 water molecules), while for solvation in 1-octanol a preequilibrated 40 A box (244 1-octanol molecules) was used.",,,
"Solute, Water, and 1-octanol were treated based on polarizable non bonded parameters and valence parameters of ARROW FF recent version (J Comput Aided Mol Des (2016) 30:977–988) which is based on QMPFF3 (J Comput Chem (2008) 29: 1242).",,,
"In-house tools in the Arbalest code and various scripts in Octave/Matlab were used for setting up the initial configuration and subsequent post processing of generated data. Solvation free energy calculations were broken into 15 lambda states, while annihilation was done for all interactions in similar way as it was done for protein-ligand complexes (as in PNAS (2008) 105:10378).",,,
"Isothermal-isobaric ensemble based molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the Nose-Hoover thermostat at T = 298 K with six chains, a time constant of 0.5 ps, and also a Berendsen thermostat at 1 atm reference pressure with a time constant for relaxation of 0.5 ps",,,
"We model Nuclear Quantum Effects in our simulation using the PIMD technique [ J Chem Phys (1994) 101:4177–4189, J Chem Phys (1999)  112:870–880.  ] based on path integral formulation of Quantum Mechanics [Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals (1965)]. We use 8 beads for water and 4 beads for octanol.",,,
"A Multiple Time Step (MTS) integration is used. Valence interactions and inter-replica harmonic interactions, which are easier to compute and more rigid, have been sampled with the time step of 0.125 fs while the more expensive non-bonded interactions have been sampled with the time step of 2 fs.",,,
"Each hydration system was simulated separately at each lambda value by minimizing in Arbalest with the steepest descents algorithm, followed by a 500 ps production phase of which we typically discarded another 100 ps as equilibration.",,,
"For solvation in 1-octanol, the system was simulated separately at each lambda value with a 5 ns production phase at each lambda value of which we typically discarded another 2 ns as equilibration.",,,
"Analysis was done with in house Octave/Matlab scripts based on thermodynamic integration using cubic-spline interpolation of the lambda points and BAR, and were used to obtain the solvation free energies (and hence predicted  partition coefficients) reported are based on BAR free energies.",,,
