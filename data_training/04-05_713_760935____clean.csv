Then again, the shows are terrible, so I suppose it's fitting that the ads match.<p>However, what about Apple's 1984 ad?  Or the BMW mini-movie advertisements they ran about 6 years ago?<p>There are some incredibly cool concept ads out there.  They usually are not the ones broadcast, but if you watch the end of the year awards for the industry, there are some very creative minds working there.  (And creating some impressive work).",1320469079

Although most of the work hasn't paid as well as gigs away from oDesk, it's worked well for me while I build up to properly paid gigs: I've just got my first one for years, after focusing mostly on moving to the US from the UK, living in an Ecovillage and raising my now-four-year-old. It took a while to get used to the oDesk tool taking a screenshot every few minutes - I found it quite humiliating at first - but after my wife pointed out it's no worse than having people glance over your shoulder in an office, I sucked it up. I like knowing I have access to the arbitration that oDesk offers if you use this tool. The automatic time tracking helped me overcome bad habits, too. I like the detailed time logs, and I like being paid weekly.",1320467708

And, if you do rename the methods or class you've mocked, you now have to update every single test for any class coupled with the changed method.<p>I've never understood endo-testing/mock objects in environments where the compiler cannot check your mocked interfaces. I also don't understand how people can aruge that you shouldn't be testing against the implementation and then say in the next breath you should be mocking out every single method call the internal implementation makes explicitly. You're just setting yourself to get lots and lots of green tests on code that will explode as soon as it hits production. Whenever I've done aggressive mock object based testing I soon have zero confidence in my tests because I get burned due to the fact that the mock objects eventually start asserting that the <i>wrong</i> behavior is <i>right</i> and my code explodes when integrated.<p>(And yes, I know the excuse here is that you should then write integration tests and functional tests too. But seriously now, how many tests are you going to end up writing for your 100 line Ruby class before you decide you're going overboard in the name of purity?)<p>Better to instead just write it so instead of worrying about no obvious deficiencies there are obviously no deficiencies (avoid side effects, state, extra coupling), and write some functional tests just to be safe. Yes, those ones that actually hit the database and test the interaction between multiple classes that TDD advocates loathe because they are so slow and impure. Slow they may be, but at least I know they're testing the code that's going to run on my servers. I'd rather have 10 tests break when I change one class that are easy to fix than have zero tests break when I change one class and let broken code get to production.",1320467700
3198941,comment,3197798.0,3198875.0,5,0,sreque,,,"The evidence for this statement best comes from a research paper* that attempts to formalize language expressibility . According to their formalization, language features are classified as macro expressible if they can be implemented in terms of local syntax transformations of other language features. The paper shows that expressivity, power, and conciseness come the most from those features that are not macro expressible. Yet, none of Xtends features seem to be in that category.<p>Since most languages don't have macros or compiler plugin frameworks, there can still be great value in adding macro expressible features, but, as I said in my previous post, these are less likely to be game changers in terms of productivity. These are the kinds of features that IDEs can make up for with templates and code generators. As an example, an anonymous class might be bulky, but it essentially provides the same feature set as a closure and the IDE is good at writing most of the boilerplate for you.<p>*see www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/scp91-felleisen.ps.gz",1320467690

The first thing it should tell you is that it prints hello for each person in a list.  Then you can put the details of how that's done in definitions below.  It allows you to write functions so that they are easy to read and so that the structure of the semantics are separate from the implementation details and the requirements of the system.<p>Java's rigid boilerplate has always stood in the way.  It would be like if every newspaper article had to list all of its sources, with full names and titles at the start of an article and then had to list events in chronological order.

I don't think he's ""unredeemable"", and he certainly deserves a lot of positive credit for a lot of things.<p>To me it seems like many people laud his charity efforts, but for them it's frequently an unexamined praise because ""charity"" is an effective applause light. It's hard to imagine that much cash attached to a charity not doing something good. (For some older criticisms, see <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/category/gates-foundation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.givewell.org/category/gates-foundation/</a> There's also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation#Criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundati...</a> )<p>Anyway, it's worth remembering why people didn't like him in the first place. Most of those reasons have to do with long-term effects of our world, not petty things like he ate toe fungus or yelled at someone. It's not like Bill Gates stole some candy which is easy to redeem for, it's like he (excuse the very loose analogy) killed people, which is much harder to make up for and has longer (in that case, permanent for the dead person) consequences. I think Erik Naggum captured part of the problem of Gates as opposed to Microsoft pretty well in one of his rants: <a href=""http://www.xach.com/naggum/articles/3141310154691952@naggum.no.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xach.com/naggum/articles/3141310154691952@naggum....</a><p>""the problem I see is not that Bill Gates has shaped the world of useless\n  trinkets in software, but has also managed to spread his competitiveness\n  and his personal fear of losing to imaginary competitors to businesses\n  and homes everywhere, so now everybody is _afraid_ of losing some battle\n  which isn't happening, instead of getting about their own lives.  like,\n  if you aren't using today's fad language in the very latest version of\n  the IDE, you'll be left behind.  aaaugh!""",1320466401
