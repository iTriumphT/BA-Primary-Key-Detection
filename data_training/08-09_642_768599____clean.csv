Unless you're code golfing or otherwise competing to fit within a certain code/binary size, you should never care about line count at all.<p>The only thing it will do is cause you to crush your lines wherever possible and code horizontally instead of vertically, which generally conflicts with readability. In fact, I'd actually impose a limit on line length to prevent just that.<p>Instead, write code that makes sense when you read it. Avoid cleverness, and DRY. Repeating yourself in the way that violates DRY principles can often make reading code more difficult because you're essentially forced to re-read repetitive code because you can't assume it's all identical.<p>The only exception to this is code standards for consistency in the code base that make sense, such as use a '{' on the same line as the definition or omit the '{}' block if the body is just 1 statement in cases where you won't violate a width constraint, etc. Anything that isn't completely reasonable as a code standard is optimizing for line count and is probably the wrong thing to do.",1365321756
