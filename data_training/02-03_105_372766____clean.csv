Why is the first law of thermodynamics so hard for people to internalize? Shall we start measuring the energy in stars in terms of grams of fat too? One expects this kind of thing on Oprah, not on HH.<p>At any rate, let's assume for a moment that the blogger is still eating the same number of calories, and doing the\nsame amount of weight lifting (that is, still burning the same number of calories), but he is still losing weight. To\nbe consistent with the 1st law of thermodynamics, it will mean he has made his body less efficient at absorbing the\ncalories in food. So he has successfully shocked his metabolism into being less efficient. Will he stay on this diet forever? Because as soon he starts eating bread again, presumably his metabolism will emerge from the state of shock he induced. When that happens, while he will feel as if he were eating the same amount of calories, he will effectively be eating much more since his metabolism will no longer be so inefficient.",1249181813

737012,comment,736794.0,736958.0,0,0,derefr,,,"The problem is that, unlike Word vs. Publisher, we don't have a set medium that we're working toward (e.g. paper.) When CSS was created, it controlled and formatted all the things that browsers could present, which wasn't very darn much. Then we thought of more things for browsers to do, and had to make our CSS much more complicated to get the same effects.<p>To give an even older parallel, when HTML was created, <i>it</i> had formatting primitives that were just fine for the browsers that existed at the time. Then, as people wanted more from browsers, spacer gifs and other such aberrations were invented to allow us to achieve our complex ideals, until we invented CSS and things were simple again, for a time.<p>The point is, the web is an ever-changing medium. We create a language for easily expressing <i>existing</i> web designs, and  then set our sights higher and bludgeon that design language into expressing <i>new</i> (and previously unachievable) designs—such as, say, multi-column text layout—until we create a new web design language and the process starts over. This isn't a problem with CSS; no matter <i>what</i> we create, it will <i>never</i> be enough. There's only so much you can do with ink on the boundaries of a page of paper; there'll never be a limit to new ways to lay out shapes and vectors in an infinitely scrollable, resizable, dynamic, animated and <i>reactive</i> space that can be variously interpreted by different clients.<p>That's not to say CSS isn't showing its age. It's just that this isn't shouldn't be considered a <i>failing</i> in the original design of CSS; rather, it should be seen as a sign of experience for web designers, that they now have newer, larger ideas that their smaller, brittler tools aren't up to expressing. Perhaps this is the best argument of all for separating content from presentation—if they're separate, we can replace CSS with something more robust (and then replace <i>that</i> with something even robust-er-er) without touching the content itself.",1249181272

I'm just thinking about my own experience with free software, and then writing what I think.<p>I do genuinely think that there are two different costs for software-- the cost to the programmer and the cost to the user. The two costs have no relation to one another.<p>I agree that you and the original author are both talking about the cost to the programmer when you say that ""free software"" is not really free, in that the programmer bears an opportunity cost, as you described earlier. That's true. You, the original author, and I all agree on that point.<p>Where we disagree, I think, is about whether that cost is important. I think that proprietary and free software have roughly the same cost to the programmer, i.e. it takes just as long, just as much effort, to write code, regardless of whether you're getting paid. Since the cost to the programmer is the same for both, it's not a distinguishing feature of free software.<p>If he just means that there is a cost to create all software, it's an obvious conclusion.
