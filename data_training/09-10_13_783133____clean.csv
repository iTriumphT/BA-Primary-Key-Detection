Mixlr uses WebSockets when available (i.e., Chrome) and falls back to Flash, so this error probably means the WebSocket port was blocked for some reason, maybe a firewall.

I don't see myself going out of the house for daily shopping with something like a segway. A car is comfortable, it has a moving chair, it has a roof, gives you the feeling of a house. I think there would be more car parks than more segways.<p>You fail a few times with your high-tech ideas and that's OK.

I think he is still off course with sustainability projects that come with difficult infrastructure problems.<p>Finally about comparing robotics olympics and real sports: doing sports is <i>cool</i>. You look cool when you play sports and sweat. Also there are the sports heroes that are real people. Do you think majority of people will find it so cool to see fighting robots?

The argument ended when I pointed out that the fact that we'd been arguing over it for an hour was a pretty good indication that it was correct, and that the presentation was in five minutes so he better decide one way or another soon.",1276334134

Not blindly being filled with derived facts with no explanation as to <i>how</i> they were derived, but rather giving them (simple) problems without any sort of solution method, and having them find possible methods on their own. (And the problems don't have to be from the natural world—they can simply be patterns, like this one is.)<p>After a few hundred, the test would be to look at all the ways they solved all the problems, and come up with a generalized method for problem-solving. Once they derive the scientific method, they pass—and get to learn all the things previous scientists found out using the method. I imagine it would forever change their attitude about those facts—they'd either be eager to build on them with their own experiments, or to know how they were derived and replicate/refute them :)",1276333981
