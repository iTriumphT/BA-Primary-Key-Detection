3365196,comment,3364437.0,3365062.0,-4,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Very well put and I'd like to add to that but before I do I'd just like to say that I don't get why you were downvoted. This is such a well reasoned, on-topic comment and it deserves more discussion. It seems any time there's a post on RMS all of his supporters jump on the thread and I,mediate ly and relentlessly downvote anything that doesn't correspond to their worldview no matter how relevant or rational it is.<p>That speaks to the larger issue you touched on about Stallman and the FSF. They like to talk about control but don't see how they're being controlling. It's as if because Stallmam believes he's doing something ""for the good of the people"" it's okay to further his cause by any means necessary. I'm hesitant to say this but it kind of reminds me of Malcolm X. Malcolm X was a very well intentioned man and his cause was a just one. The only problem was that he went to extremes, glossed over the gray areas, and refused to accept any other view no matter how good a point the other side made.<p>You can be a supporter of free software while still supporting proprietary software. What Stallman is arguing for takes control out of the hands of the creators and gives it not to the people but the FSF. It's like Stalinist Russia except for software. For the good of the people everyone should own your work.<p>Stallman's views make some assumptions that are unacceptable.<p>1. He assumes people want to be able to modify the applications they use. Not so. In fact, most people I'd argue acquire software so they don't have to write code. I don't download a text editor because I want to extend it. I do it because it helps me get something else done. I choose the software that meets my needs. If I wanted to toy with source code I'd build my own IDE, compiler, etc and start everything from scratch.<p>2. It assumes everyone is, wants to be, or should be a programmer. What use is the source code if it looks like gibberish to you? This view glosses over the fact that the majority of users don't give one iota of a shit about programming. They just want to watch YouTube or write their English class essay.<p>3. It assumes that anything closed source must have something sneaky within it. Okay, so there's spyware and back doors in a lot of proprietary software. That doesn't mean the guy that doesn't release the source of his text editor (I'm thinking of my new favorite editor, Chocolate for Mac) is spying on you or doing anything malicious at all.<p>4. It assumes that anyone who supports, uses, or develops free software is on the honor system and would never do anything unethical. I think the part where he suggests that free software can be charged for is laughable. If you release anything under GPL you can be reasonably sure someone will take your source and give away some free version of your program or even derive something else and make money off your hard work. Red Hat Linux is not a good rebuttal of this point. Most software, especially from indie devs, doesn't lend itself to the Red Hat business model well at all.<p>Programming is a very valuable skill and the creators of great software deserve to choose how they license and distribute that software. Stallman wants to take choice away from one group and give it to, well, no one really. I'd argue we have choice now. I want to be able to choose proprietary software if it meets my needs and I want to be able to not only charge people for my work but make sure they cannot turn around and undermine my efforts by deriving or giving away my work. That's very reasonable. I love free software and use it often but I can't say there's anything evil about it. There's this sense of entitlement to Stallman's message that I don't like too.",1324158703

Math is another.<p>There are other skills that might have less of an impact than literacy, but have a direct impact on society and the quality of life for everyone. History and science are good examples here. History because being knowledgeable about the politics of yesterday helps in framing political decisions today. Science because our lives have been affected by (and improved by) science for the past few hundred years.<p>Having a populous that's informed about the benefits of science and technology and how they affect all of our lives should help everyone make better decisions regarding the two -- from a mom who mixes ammonia and bleach to clean her floor to the congressman who brushed off Vint Cerf's testimony during the SOPA hearing with a comment about nerds.<p>So, while we should encourage people to follow their passions and explore interesting topics, I'm comfortable saying that we should encourage certain things like math, reading, science, and history over game design, running a business, or basket weaving.",1324158218

I was asking about that legal detail.<p>If a business were to pay 5000 third-party individuals to ""Like"" a page, that business might not have a Facebook page and may have never agreed to the Facebook ToS.

If someone gave me money to Like something, I might go check it out, and actually, truly, like it. Then what? What if I Liked the thing but gave the money back?

Of course, if you're smart, you'll drive a hard bargain, knowing that in the future you won't be able to.  Stallman says that choice simply should not exist in that proprietary software should not exist.<p>The 'sell support' thing has some fairly serious limitations that make it less than ideal.  Many software products - especially the end user variety - cost a lot to make.  Selling 'support' for a product that works well and doesn't require much of it is not a good way to recoup all those sunk costs.<p>Since you cite 'countless' companies, how about we actually count a few and look at their revenue models?<p>* Redhat: first of all, they distribute a lot more software than they produce, which is fine, but the scope for that is pretty limited.  Also, they basically use trademark law as an end-run around software freedom.  You can't redistribute and call it Redhat, and you can't buy any support unless it's real Redhat, and support is a subscription, not a per-incident kind of thing.<p>* Mysql: they used the ""GPL'ed library code"" gig to try and get people wanting to embed the code in their proprietary products to cough up some cash.  Legitimate business model, but would not work <i>without proprietary software</i>!  Also, most things aren't libraries.<p>What else?",1324157057

3365143,comment,3364437.0,3364975.0,3,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Exactly! That's my biggest problem with Stallman's beliefs. Let's take Red Hat Linux for example. Anyone can get or modify Linux free. Even Red Hat itself is open source. So Rwd Hat can't really make a buck selling Linux so they make money on training and support. If I wanted Red Hat I could certainly find an ISO somehwere online easily or I could just download Fedora. So for them it's great but what about the guy who writes a cool text editor for Linux? If that's open source then what does he do? Hope everyone sticks to the honor system and pays? How do you make money charging for support with that type of project?<p>There are far more projects like the example I gave than companies like Red Hat. You're far more likely to find little solo acts who either can't provide support, dont want to, or even if they did wouldn't be able to sell it because it's just not that necessary. Imagine buying a license for support for some text editor you like and calling the support line to ask how to program in some macro or something. It's just not happening.<p>Why do FOSS folks always equate closed software with evil? Couldnt we simply want to keep our code to ourselves so we can make money? In most cases 90% of the value of a developer's app comes from the fact that no one else has the code. Just because I've closed the source doesn't mean I'm adding back doors and spyware to my app. It just means I'm protecting my income stream. Demanding that all software release code so that people can extend the app to their liking presupposes that people <i>want</i> to modify the code. Of all the FOSS software I've downloaded and used I really haven't ever wanted to modify the app except in a few rare cases. It sometimes seems like this FOSS ideology completely forgets that not everyone is a programmer or assumes everyone should want to be a programmer.",1324156661
