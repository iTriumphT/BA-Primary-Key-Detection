Over the years, I've gotten a few upgrades in equipment (HD), but didn't really take advantage of an initial deal.  Overall, I've been pretty happy with them.<p>All of the sudden, this summer, out of the blue, they give me Showtime for free for 3 months.  They just sent me a letter to let me know.  They even sent me an email, just to make sure I knew.  I don't know how many people got this bonus, or how I was chosen, but it worked out great for me, since the 5th season of ""Weeds"" had just started :)<p>Then while I'm setting up an older TV, I need to redo some setup.  I found I could do it on their website, and sent customer service an email to thank their devs for making it ridiculously simple to do.  Boom... Starz/Encore free for 3 months.<p>Now, DirecTV tends to run at a bit of a premium to some other providers, but I like their HD a lot.  I've looked at switching to cable or AT&T's Uverse, but ultimately just stuck with DirecTV.  I suspect that a lot of people these days have been re-evaluating if that premium was worth it.<p>These little bonuses this summer made me like my decision more.  Sure, it was a pretty cheap thing for them to do, and free premium channels is a common lure for new subscribers, and I really appreciated it.",1254198012

He used to be a partner at Bain consulting but the premise of his books is that consumer loyalty has value and it's worth the time of organizations to measure and maximize that value...<p>He makes similar points you have that it doesn't make sense to charge new customers more than existing clients because existing clients add more value through things like referrals, they buy more services at lower cost, they no longer incur acquisition costs, etc.  An example of trying the alternative would be places like my gym which happens to be a national chain - whose membership services I hate but I bought a while back and they don't up membership costs for old clients but they do for new ones.  My membership costs probably about half that of new members because I joined a good 6-7 years ago which makes it rather unlikely that I'll ever give it up.<p>Personally I think the reliance and dependence of a lot of service companies like Comcast on the value of their infrastructure is a dangerous game given how much the cost of infrastructure has fallen and continues to fall.",1254197496
