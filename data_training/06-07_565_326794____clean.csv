Most ad sales for publishers runs through an RFP process that is managed mostly by agencies, not the brands. There are a ton of brands looking spend money in this way, but ultimately you have to have someone that is good at closing, as well as maximizing the value of your inventory.<p>This person, of course, is very difficult to find for a publisher of any size.<p>My point however, I wouldn't make the mistake of thinking the online ad sales business is a bunch of modern day Don Draper types... it's much, much less interesting.",1330066652

The process that allows to generate new ideas, new ways to do something, is basically the same one for each of us:<p>1) The starting point is always the observation of anomalies     in an existing system or pattern. \n2) You reason on those anomalies in your head, alone.\n3) You come up with a possible response, alone.\n4) You visualize in your head how this response would actually works. This should be practiced until you see it working smoothly from beginning to end. You do this alone.\n5) Finally you set to work in order to bring this response into our physical world. Either alone or in a group-work<p>(The above needs some further explanation but this will bring me out of track now.

I think the quote is just a rant against the pains of pushing innovation in corporate environments, that any engineer could write just as well in a moment of frustration - anyone in engineering should recognize a familiar note as he starts talking about committees and marketing people.<p>Every engineer already goes through a lot of struggle designing the initial prototype of the thing being designed, analyses the constraints involved, tries out different alternatives attempting to find the sweet spot that will satisfy them all etc. Then, exhausted and in love with the product of his effort, he shows it to people at some company or institution and they all have something to say or add to something the engineer perceives as already perfect or almost perfect, some might have valuable criticism, but some might just have no idea about the constraints involved because they didn't put in that much time into analysis, some just want to have their share in the potential success, some have to think about how to actually sell it etc. That surely is overwhelming, but it is part of the engineers work and I don't think ""Work alone"" is advice of  much value. You simply have to accept this is just as an important part of your work as the design itself - I think most people never do. Then, you can starting learning how to best deal with it. Also, find a team or/and organization that you actually like, or at least can tolerate.",1330063794

With Dancer and other Perl frameworks there's not a lot of info online besides the framework docs.\nWith Ruby, you can use Heroku, while Perl you're going to need to use a Heroku buildpack to get it working which is more work.<p>I don't know if vi has syntax editing for Ruby, but I would imagine it does.<p>Perl would be easier to learn but wouldn't really give you any extra benefits over Python. It would probably be just as good to use a Python framework, either Bottle or Flask.\nRuby is much more OO, has better framework resources and is different enough from Python that its worth learning",1330063655
