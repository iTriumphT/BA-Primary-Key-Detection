If you reverse engenear a program create a spec and have someone else code to that spec then copyright does not cover you.<p>You could create an original novel that was not a derivative work by taking once sentience from every book in a library and trying to create a meaningful work of art from it.  Doing the same thing using a single book would probably not fly.,1319893174

It saves a company 100K over the year, I am loved by the customers, and because it is so simple, it normally requires no maintenance. Maybe we update the fields once a year or so.<p>At the end of the week, I've already saved the company more than my salary. After a year, I am a critical asset to the company.<p>After 3 years, I've optimized everything, the ROI slows down, and I move on.<p>This pattern is not a tragedy. It doesn't crush your soul. It makes you a prized commodity in the business world, with a chance to make a change in your life every few years.<p>I have usually alternated between 3 years doing this, then 2 years doing startup work. It has given me a much broader base of experience and skill than anyone who stick to one one side of the coin. \nIt also has given me years of experience in large industries (banking, energy, etc.) which I then use to find very real problems to which a startup can be applied.<p>I have led a very satisfying career, doing this for almost 20 years now.",1319892755
