I'd like to bring together some hackers; the idea is to be able to meet like-minded people.\nTypically, societies meet up once or twice a week.<p>My question: any ideas on what could be done during such a meeting (typically 1-2 hours)? Some possible things include:<p>- short (10min) lectures on interesting stuff<p>- programming competitions<p>- forming up into teams to work on individual projects<p>- ...<p>However, this is all still very rough. If you guys have any better/more concrete ideas, I'd be very glad to hear them!",1224079080

It's one thing to offer capital during a crisis, it's another thing to force capital during a crisis at set rates.<p>I'd be more comfortable if the government said, we are offering $250bn in capital to American banks and those banks are able to bid for pieces of it.  Those with the most attractive bids will get it.<p>How is this different?  Simple, it makes the banks offer as much in return as they see in their interest giving the government the best deal.  There's no reason to reward companies that can't raise capital on the open market with a sweetheart deal.  If some banks are unwilling to bid up for that capital, that's fine.  They can look to the open market for capital or maybe (basically just Wells Fargo) they're in a strong position from good management.",1224078095

You just make sure that your methods return the current object if you want them to be chainable.<p>The real JavaScript of jQuery doesn't happen when you're writing simple transformations on the page, instead, you really get deep into it once you start extending jQuery through plugins. To really write these correctly, you need a deep understanding of JavaScript (because you'll be reading the jQuery source code at many points).<p>More than anything else, jQuery is an API to make the DOM manageable (itself an API of sorts).<p>What's great about JavaScript in many ways is that it's not Python (which is also great in so many ways): It's very flexible and lets you write your code as you see fit. I don't think that jQuery could happen so easily and cleanly in many other languages.<p>But any serious object-oriented language needs to be able to method chain, and it needs to feel natural.

Not only purists, but developing country policymakers, worry that Krugman is part of the shifting intellectual climate in the United States that has become ambivalent about keeping markets for goods and services open. Now that he also has the imprimatur of the Nobel Committee, Paul Krugman has a special responsibility to retain his cosmopolitan and internationalist credentials. At this time of financial crisis, Krugman should be reminding us that shutting down markets for trade helped transform the depression of the 1930s into the Great Depression.""<p>I'm open to discourse, just not impressed with the downmodding as a result of going against the herd over here. I've found economics a subject of some interest, but even with as much math as it takes, my _opinion_ is that it is far from a hard science like physics. So pointing out that politics and people's biases are involved shouldn't be such a freaking big deal, in my opinion. And that goes with Hayek, Friedman, and Krugman. My comment holds for all of them.

Monetizing Twitter is a no-brainer if it <i>has</i> to happen. If the company runs out of money, they could do a token layoff of a couple people, issue a desperate plea to their user community with the headline SAVE TWITTER, and a bunch of us will pony up $19.99 a year.<p>I don't expect them to do that. There are all sorts of more subtle ways to bring in money, and I expect that they will try all of those first, serially or in parallel. They're trying to be very sure not to set a price so high that they can be undercut. If they avoid that mistake, they can own their niche for a decade or more.<p>It's also obvious why we haven't seen any attempts yet: Twitter is still recovering from the effects of the Fail Whale phase.<p>Now that Twitter operations are stabilized, I believe they still have a bunch of smaller competitors. It would be a mistake to drive traffic to those competitors by inelegant monetizing. It would be a better idea to let the competition die from lack of oxygen first. It would be even <i>better</i> if some of Twitter's competitors, driven by necessity, were compelled to experiment with charging money before Twitter does. Some of the best market research is that which your competitors do for free.
