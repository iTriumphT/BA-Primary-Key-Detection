7867237,comment,7866795.0,7867156.0,22,0,angersock,,,Yep. The big reason that the convenient approximations (lies) we use in mechanical and civil engineering work is that it is expected that the implementer of our designs (elaborate lies) doesn&#x27;t use the wrong parts--there are <i>exhaustive</i> specifications on things as boring as bolts and threads and welds <i>specifically</i> to ensure that the behavior they exhibit is within the realm of what the designer expects.<p>It&#x27;s nice to see software engineering practices being backported to more conservative and stagnant forms of engineering. 8),1402293429

Sometimes, things go smoothly, but in the worst cases, like this one, there&#x27;s a huge mismatch between &#x27;Western&#x27; quality demands and the output of their Chinese partners.<p>The typical pattern will be for the manufacturer to start sending back work which is totally unacceptable. When their partner protests, the manufacturer will grudgingly raise the standard to &#x27;barely tolerable&#x27;. Time runs out, exhaustion sets in, decision makers don&#x27;t want to draw attention to the fact that they chose the wrong manufacturer - so the client has to lower their standards.<p>Caltrans officials were amazingly naive and blinkered if they weren&#x27;t aware of the long history of stories just like this one. Perhaps they did know the history, and they thought they would be protected by quality checks embedded in the contract, but that&#x27;s just more naivety. Contracts don&#x27;t have much power in that environment, particularly when your project is already falling way behind schedule.<p>Blaming &#x27;The Chinese&#x27; though, is stupid.

Their experience involves a fair amount of in-store exploration. For them placing milk and loaf of bread far apart might arguably be beneficial, because it makes them go past all of that other stuff they may forget to buy otherwise. Indeed, I imagine such customers are also easier to upsell to and more prone to impulse purchases of products that yield better margins—and that&#x27;s part of the shopping process they visit the store for. Alas, people seem to enjoy buying things.<p>In short, I wouldn&#x27;t be so confident that a store with more ‘rational’ layout would score better in the eye of the customer, even all else equal.<p>Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t work in this area of business and this is purely my speculation.",1402291274

I am guessing it is not getting picked much for new, greenfield projects. I think that is a cut-off metric. One way get there is to find a niche. Maybe it isn&#x27;t the new use-for-everything language. But at least can become the &quot;ok, use for this one area&quot; language.<p>C -- still winning in that respect. It is used in many places just because of hardware or time constraints -- drivers, micro-controllers, optimized fast parses, low level socket handling code. It just got specialized. Not used probably for business or back-end systems.<p>I don&#x27;t think PERL can claim that same. It seems to me its role has been replaced by Python, maybe Ruby, Java (for web server back-ends).<p>C++ still winning. None of the current languages including the new contenders like Rust and Go can eat its lunch (as they say) when it comes to performance. Things like games or signal processing. Anything requiring low latency responses will still see C++ being picked. And with C++11 and C++14 it is getting a new breath of fresh air. Whoever is going to contend with, will have a steep hill to climb.<p>Java? Java still winning. Now if you think of Java as JVM it is winning even more. Java itself if just a very average language that is also fairly performant, explicit, IDE friendly. If you had a lot of money and could hire potentially lots of average or below average programmers to throw at a problem (which I think often is the wrong approach, but if you did), Java is your language. And Android. Don&#x27;t forget Android. If anything it is winning just because of that.<p>> Give it 5-10 years and I expect to read &quot;Why Python Didn&#x27;t Win&quot;.

I doubt many people, when asked, will say that popularity implies credibility. Credibility is not what&#x27;s driving these people, it&#x27;s just the popularity, plain and simple. There&#x27;s a difference.",1402290175

7867113,story,,,4,2,anupshinde,Would you do consulting and product development simultaneously?,,"Would you do consulting and product development (bootstrapped) simultaneously?<p>I left my job to start working on my own thing (SaaS based product and bootstrapped). I had created certain prototypes and sent couple of surveys to check what the market needs. Financially I set myself certain targets before I quit and have between 18-22 months of time to sustain (for myself - with no employees and zero income). So far it looks pretty good.<p>My initial thought process was to do consulting + product development. Unfortunately, I have ended up taking up too many hours of consulting work for the next 9-12 months (and cutting down hours means losing it completely). And the pay is near my expectations and much better than my day job (a bit above 2.5 times). This will also significantly boost my financial savings in a short time.<p>BUT  -  I would end up with very less time to work on my own product(s). One option for me is to hire somebody to develop the product while i just do some sales/marketing and product management work (5-6 hours weekly). The other option is to quit consulting and work on the product myself full time - and then hire people later when product starts growing.<p>I think I may have ended up making the wrong choice by taking up too many hours of consulting assignments. (I am weak at delegation - and this may just be a fear out of that weakness.)<p>Have you been through this experience before? And what choices would you make?<p>P.S: At the moment I am not in a situation to hire somebody and not do any consulting work - In that case I&#x27;d go bankrupt within a year.",1402290162
