People living in a big city tend to have two to zero children and that makes country population unsustainable. On the upside, you can always find a good school for your few children if you care.<p>In recent times I don't see many children on the streets. It seems that children are being turned into indoors pets. This is sad. Adults feel obliged to drive children around to their activities. The pedophile hysteria being promoted by media doesn't help either.<p>In other word, it's sad.",1327575487

3513607,comment,3513298.0,3513298.0,1,0,gosub,,,"There are two problems here: package management and version management.\nPackage management is a wheel that has been reinvented a thousand times: every major distro has its own (yum, apt, pacman, portage), many modern programming languages have one (cpan, cran, pear, gems, cabal, npm) and also some applications (elpa for emacs). Sometimes even git is used as a package manager. This is a source of confusion (""should I install ruby via apt?""), conflicts (""I installed perl compiled from source, then I installed a package with my distro manager that pulled perl as a dependency. Which perl are my scripts using now?"") and a general sense of unease (""software is spread all over my filesystem! argh!""). I wished that some common use case were found and unified under a unique software or library.\nThen there is version management. The linux ecosystem dealt with this for dinamic libraries with a common name scheme, soft links, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Then we have rvm for ruby and virtual env for python. These are not solutions, only hacks.\nI think that one of the root problem is that the unix model lacks something like namespaces. Hitting tab on my  shell (under debian) suggests 2706 possible completions. This is not sustainable and hinders discoverability.\n</end rant>",1327575367

Most bigger cities have multiple providers, some are backed by car manufacturers, some are independent.<p>So if you want to pick up lots of beverages for your birthday party next weekend and don't feel like hauling them back in public transport or with your bike, you can just rent a car for x minutes, go shopping, drive home, park it in a reserved place in you neighborhood.<p>The price model of most providers is however not the best for the visit grandma in the countryside problem, but most of those carsharing companies have special tarifs with rental providers, so you can get a relatively cheap car for the weekend.<p>The way it technically works is almost always the same: You sign up and you get an RFID Key Card. You go on the internet or use an App to see if a car is available in your area and book it. You go to the car, open it with you keycard and find the keys in the glovebox. Sometimes you have to put in a PIN first.

Elections are held with a proportional system across Europe, so it's quite easy for MEPs to lose seats to smaller parties; this basically forces them to listen to constituents, most of the time, or risk being defeated by, say, Greens or Pirate Party. Since they don't really have much of a say in nominating the ""EU government"" (i.e. the Commission), they don't really experience the drawbacks of such a system.<p>The problem is, in most cases the Parliament cannot veto what the Commission approves. There is a constant, constitutional struggle between them, but the Commission has the upper hand in most cases. This is because the Commission is nominated by (and directly works with) member states; in practice, if all states' governments agree to something, the EU Parliament probably wouldn't be able to stop them.

I am one of Cleartrip's founders and I'd like to clarify how things actually work.<p>Firstly, the ""X seats left"" feature is not an 'algorithm' at all. It is a simple count of the number of 'seats remaining' at a specific price point for a specific flight departure.<p>In the example illustrated in the post, there is only a single seat left at a price point of Rs. 34,255. This does not mean that there is only one seat left on the flight, it means there is only one seat left at that specific price.<p>When the search was repeated for 2 travellers, the price per person increased to 35,746, and then increased to Rs. 37,008 per person when the search was done for 4 travellers.<p>Airline pricing is based on 'fare classes' or 'buckets'. Buckets typically work like this:<p>1. Each bucket is allocated a fixed number of seats.<p>2. Each bucket is associated with exactly one price point<p>3. When there are no more seats available in a bucket, seats from the next highest bucket are displayed and so on<p>At Cleartrip, we work hard to give our customers the best prices. We never have and never will engage in the ""fake scarcity tactics"" that this post accuses us of.<p>I'd also like to point out again that we have a tool tip on the button that clearly reads that there are 'X seats left at this price'.",1327573150

No distribution upgrade necessary.<p>For Ruby the development in Ruby-land is so fast that trying to bundle the latest JRuby or Rubinius would be a losing battle. And you also need packages installed only for the current user, if only because devs constantly experiment with beta-quality libraries and major versions have a habit of breaking backwards compatibility. How are you going to solve that with DEBs or RPMs?<p>And you could say that Linux distributions shouldn't have versions and just upgrade stuff as soon as they are available.
