And holding parents more accountable for how their children are doing.<p>With respect to 1 and 3, changing kid's attitude is not what school is for.  That's the parent's job.  Further, and you are probably too young to realize this, but ALL teens have bad attitudes.  White, black, or polka dot purple.  I am at that unfortunate age where I am obliged to pay both elementary school and University tuition.  I can tell you from experience that doing homework and getting good grades are about as important to your AVERAGE teen aged girl as Mom and Dad say they are.  And certainly no MORE important.<p>So when you say that black teens have bad attitudes . . . to a parent this is not entirely surprising.  ALL teens have bad attitudes.  It is up to parents and teachers to put boots to butts and force education onto what in most cases will be unwilling students.  Notice I didn't say that they needed to explain to the student why it is good to get an education.  That doesn't work with white kids, and I have no reason to believe that it would work with black kids.  Parents and teachers shouldn't negotiate with kids.  We should direct them.  As wsprague intimated, it is not about kids being satisfied or having fun, or even wanting an education.",1253768212

840633,comment,840523.0,840523.0,0,0,tdavis,,,"You know, it <i>is</i> a great book and I love Jamie's interview and the ""duct tape"" style was used well at Netscape, but just because the guy doesn't writing unit tests or use higher-level abstractions doesn't automatically make him better than other types. Some of the smartest programmers I've met have been religious about TDD and strict formatting and commenting and as a result maintain and work on some incredibly large and complex systems.<p>Did those systems start out that way? Maybe not, but after a few years and a couple rewrites I'm sure they came to the same conclusion that most programmers do when they work on things for a <i>long</i> time: ""I wish I could go back and write some tests / automate some stuff / add better debugging, etc."" I know I always feel that way. I do now, after about a year and a half of hacking together our site. I'd <i>kill</i> for a decent test suite and fully-automated deployment. Kill!<p>Both styles of programming have a purpose. Maybe we'd like to <i>avoid</i> multi-threaded architectures, but it isn't always possible. When you have 6 weeks to launch, maybe unit tests aren't necessary, but eventually not having them will start doing more harm than good.<p>The more I read the writings of celebrity programmers / entrepreneurs, the more I come to realize that most of what they write reads like an attempt to justify their way of thinking as being The Right Way. Why can't we all just agree there is more than one way to skin a cat and each probably has an applicable use case or two?",1253767982

Perhaps you are too heavily focused on the specifics (unit testing, etc) instead of the overall theme. He's basically saying that while the other guys are wasting time overengineering a project, sometimes just getting to work and getting started is a much more productive approach.<p>Joel isn't directly bad-mouthing unit testing or multithreading, but as developers we tend to think about all of these cool toys we can use and ""ooooh"" and ""ahhhh"" instead of actually shipping code.

Have you tried to go into code that someone threw in to just make it work.<p>Abstraction, interfaces and unit tests are not a leisurely activity for academic developers.  We use them to make the code less complex and maintain.  The cost of development isn't the initial code base, its the fixes and additional features people want AFTER the initial release(s).  Going back into the code and safely making changes or adding code with these in place reduces time.<p>I had an application without automated testing, it cost the company almost 2000 man hours to test the system every time they made a release.<p>Design patterns, Joel, are repeatable patterns within code.  Design patterns are again to help when another developer goes into the code they can see what the heck the original developer tried to accomplish.<p>To summarize, I would suggest you out source some code to the far east.  They will get it done really fast for you.  And yes it will only work 50% of the time.

840613,comment,840523.0,840567.0,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"I see what you're saying, and I agree. It's not comparable to COM.<p>I think the thing is, articles like this tend to create some idealized programmer that is just a conglomeration of attributes the author likes <i>even if they are mutually exclusive</i>. To me, avoiding complexity and doing bit manipulation are mutually exclusive.<p>It's like saying you should use left shift (or is it right...?) instead of diving by 2. Ok, it may be faster. Or the compiler may just do the same thing regardless how you type your code. The point is that ""/ 2"" means divide by 2 to anyone at all familiar with code. Unless you have some really compelling reason to do otherwise, you should use ""/ 2"".<p>Using shifts for division (or various other bit manipulation) may be how your idealized programmer shows their classical training, but don't kid yourself into thinking that bit manipulation fits into all your other ideals for programmers.<p>Joel's idealized programmer also avoids unit tests. Are you serious? How can this <i>possibly</i> be a good idea? No, your customers don't care if you wrote unit tests... in the same way you don't care if your architect does whatever it is architects do to ensure the accuracy of their work. But that's just the point. You don't care (nor should you) about <i>how</i> they ensure accuracy. You care only that they do. So no, your customer doesn't care if you wrote unit tests, but I assure you they care if your software crashes or gives inaccurate information.<p>Of course, no one ever creates an idealized programmer without creating their opposite. Joel's ""ideally"" bad programmer multiply inherits from 17 sources. Does any sane programmer really do this? No. Of course not. Why bother mentioning it? It's like saying an idealized pilot is not like those other pilots that intentionally crash their planes. Well... <i>no one</i> intentionally crashes a plane. Don't bring up absurd examples to prove your point. If real life doesn't prove it, then it's not a valid point.<p>The simple fact is that when I look at my own real-life, deployed-in-production code, I find this: The code I wrote just to get a problem solved in whatever way possible (duct tape) becomes more and more of a liability as the requirements change. With the code that I spent the most time designing (assuming I eventually came up with a good design), the more the requirements change, the more I see the beauty of the design. When a change in requirements can be fixed with a find/replace, it's a job well done. Duct tape code leads to duct tape maintenance. Duct tape maintenance leads to thedailywtf.com.<p>I have no problem with emphasizing the importance of shipping software. I have a problem with people saying ""real programmers use butterflies"" when they aren't writing a web comic.<p>I don't think there's a single ""real programmers"" article in the universe that is internally consistence (doesn't advocate any mutually exclusive practices). Like I said, it's an ideal, an ideal constructed out of everything the author could find in their mind, whether it fits together or not. This wouldn't be a problem if the author admitted even a slight possibility of exaggeration or lack of internal consistency, but they never do.<p>Now... I think by now I've probably exaggerated and broken internal consistency enough for one day, so I'll stop here.",1253766224
