It seems like an experiment should have already been done.<p>For example, one could arrange an experiment with two groups of rats.

If rats from R develop cancer and rats from C don't, then it is known that Benzene <i>does</i> cause cancer at low doses.  Otherwise, if the experiment is repeated a sufficient number of times, the chance that Benzene causes cancer in low doses is statistically irrelevant.<p>Our points are the same:  it is not generally known whether cancer can actually be caused by low doses of Benzene, so it is detrimental to freak over sensationalist articles like this one.<p>Also, it is especially distasteful to frighten people by claiming that there is some measure of truth (""science"") in these inherently unscientific claims.",1222889295

That should include me being able to be exposed to new ideas, new people, new opinions, and likewise being able to express my ideas and my opinions.  I think one of the big problems that we've seen with the new Facebook, and resulting decline in Widgets, is they took away a large portion of what allowed people to be different on Facebook.  I will admit I use Facebook for only 2 purposes... I use it to play Mobwars (a random and pointless game) and to chat with my friends (not via messages but that IM program in that handy little bar at the bottom of the page).  I don't ever visit anyone's profiles... I've had a hell of a time trying to find groups and such that are interesting to join, as with pages.
