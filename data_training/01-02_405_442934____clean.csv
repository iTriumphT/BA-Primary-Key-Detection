It was very doable, because even constructs like conditional logic and ""looping"" (really iterators) were just ordinary calls. For example, if you wanted to implement ""fuzzy logic"" in Smalltalk it would just take a mere minutes to implement some methods like:<p><pre><code>    ifTrue:ifFalse:ifMaybe:\n</code></pre>\nThen define a Maybe class and use it as the Maybe value and park some methods like that on it. Then this would let you write code like:<p><pre><code>    result\n        ifTrue: [ ""condition 1"" ]\n        ifFalse: [ ""something else"" ]\n        ifMaybe: [\n            ""handle maybe""\n        ].</code></pre>",1352685042

4771228,comment,4769326.0,4770730.0,1,0,bigiain,,,"To stretch the cloud/powercompany analogy (perhaps too far)<p>The power company only provides a ""standard"" volt and amp rated supply, and just like cloud computing, there are various standards to choose from[1]. You're probably thinking ""120V 60Hz AC with type-b plugs"", whereas for me the default assumption is ""220V 50Hz AC with type-1 plugs"". Fortunately, half my electronics doesn't actually care what voltage/frequency/current is available thanks to modern power supplies (I've seen my iMac happily keep running during a brown-out where the wall sockets were measuring just 90V AC, while all the routers/modems/harddrives with less capable power supplies were flickering and rebooting continuously.) Other devices I own I can use a transformer to change my 220V down to 120V, though still at 50Hz. If I needed to (and I never have) I could use a US targeted UPS or inverter to provide 120V AC @ 60Hz.<p>The ""cloud"" market is kinda the same. Cloud storage, for example, expects 8 bit bytes delivered over tcp (or perhaps udp). In general, ""everything just deals with that"", pretty much every modern-ish 8/16/32/64 bit device, regardless of native endianness, will happily emit and receive the same 8 bit bytes that S3 stores (converting on the fly, much like a switchmode power supply does for voltages). If you're an edge-case customer, perhaps wanting to use Amazon S3 to store data for your 12bit wide ""bytes"" from your PDP8, you just convert them on the way in and out. And much like the end result of electricity consumption is pretty much all the same, electricity is mostly just converted into heat - but with side effects varying from cooling your beer to blasting pixels onto your screen at 100fps to making your coffee machine hot; ultimately cloud storage is all just ordered bytes more-or-less reliably stored and retrieved - whether that's plain text passwords, or massively de-duped mp3s in Dropbox or Amazon/Apples cloud music storage, or cryptographically secure blobs which no-one can tell whether they contain your bank records or your secret research project data or child porn - it's all just bytes. There's no ""vendor lockin"" at the ""it's just a bunch of ordered bytes"" level. You might need to ""change the plugs"" if you want to switch you cloud storage from S3 to BigTable to Dropbox to Tahoe/LAFS, just like I need to switch cables or use a plug adaptor for US delivered electrical equipment. It's the same with cloud compute resources - sure EC2 and Linode and CloudNine and AppEngine have different interfaces, but you can view that as all just the plumbing on the way into the ""remote universal turing mschine"" which, much like the topologists who can't tell the difference between their coffee mug and their donut, in spite of their interface and language differences all the programmable remote computing offerings are identical - if you can compute anything on one of them, you can - in theory- compute it on any of them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity_by_country"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity_by_country</a>",1352683639

The y axis currently ranges from 12,046,000 to 12,050,000, which makes the decrease look like a sharp 45 falloff, when in fact it's fallen by 0.02% during the time shown. The numbers are <i>the same</i> to within four significant digits. So what is this supposed to be telling me?",1352682111

For example, if your project has a lot of serializers, then you might have a package that contains them. Or you might create a bunch of static methods on a single ""SerializerUtils"" class.<p>The other thing is that I prefer symmetry. I would probably write the function to take and return the same thing.<p>Finally, I might strongly consider writing a generic method that, using reflection, traverses arbitrary data structures and constructs an XML DOM. The caller can do what it needs, e.g. serialize into a string.<p>If, for some reason, your system requires a specific transformation from a custom data structure into a string, then it belongs in the custom data structure class - possibly a toString method, or something more specific.<p><pre><code>  RouterMessageHeader.toXMLString();\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>  XMLSerializer.stringify(routerMessageHeader);</code></pre>",1352682057
