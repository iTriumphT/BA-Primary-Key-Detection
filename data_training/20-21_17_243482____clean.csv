Unnecessarily squashing (what you described, in git terms) is a mistake, but not really of the kind Linus is talking about. He's talking about things like ""I committed a couple of commits, then took a different approach with a couple of more commits, then realized that didn't work and went for a different answer, then took a couple of commits to clean up the resulting debug code"". There's no reason to leave all the temporary debug code (as opposed to permanent logging code) in there, or to leave the abortive approach in the history for others.

And there, changing the Windows adoption rate requires visionary people in charge, a complete set of applications on another platform, and a realistic transition path.<p>I haven't seen a lot of vision in current IT groups; more like, CYA.  So it may take a generation or more before enough of the establishment changes to even consider moving away from the current stack of Windows/IE-based enterprise software (the quality of which is oddly irrelevant to many managers).  Either that, or a catastrophe so substantial that upper management is forced to start over with IT.<p>Making competing applications on other platforms is technically doable.  But, unfortunately, most of the work that needs doing isn't <i>interesting</i>.  Years have gone by, and it shouldn't be surprising that people have avoided spending their precious free time developing open-source business apps when they could do something more fun.

655345,comment,654578.0,654719.0,0,0,jcl,,,"The article does have a point, though: The dominant rewards system of games has changed.<p>Games were once designed primarily to be challenging and only secondarily to be completed -- essentially equating difficulty with fun.  Today, games are designed primarily to be completed and only secondarily to be challenging -- equating completion with fun.  Of course, it's a matter of opinion which design is actually more fun.<p>This is why today we have difficulty levels, completion percents, unlockables, collectibles, achievements, etc.: to allow players that value completion to complete the game, but also to allow those that value difficulty to find a challenge.  While these design elements are a good compromise between the two extremes, the author is correct that they diminish the value of the game's nominal completion and that they tend to reward time spent in the game over skill.<p>We can partly blame economics for the rise of these game mechanics: Games that have a reputation of being ""too hard"" rarely do well.  Likewise, if a player has completed a game, he is more likely to buy its sequel than if he is still struggling with the original...  The sooner players complete a game, the sooner they can buy another.",1244837559
