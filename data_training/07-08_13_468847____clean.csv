There's a few successful tech entrepreneurs from the 80s and 90s but they don't really get the web.  And the angel and VC communities are tiny and unsophisticated.<p>Sure we could have backed ourselves, left our Melbourne lives behind and headed for Silicon Valley in the hope of finding a way to make things work. And had there not been any other option, perhaps we might have tried that, although at our age, probably not.<p>YC allowed us to fast-track the whole process.  In the space of 5 months we went from just another unknown little startup from Melbourne to demoing our product to some of the world's most astute tech investors and being acclaimed by fellow startup founders and high-profile Valley identities alike.<p>That's not to say we've succeeded... we have a huge task ahead of us.  But YC has helped us do in a few short months what might have taken us years any other way.",1239867869

His arguments are all very biased and do not inform.<p>Priming has similar effects as hypnosis, and is increasingly believed to be linked. 1/3 of people react negatively to priming and hypnosis, something that is rarely mentioned. Hypnosis research has repeatedly shown that you cannot get someone to believe something they don't want to, or to do something they don't want to. There's a very nice scene in Mythbusters where a researcher clearly refuses a hypnotic suggestion, and then quickly comes out of the hypnosis. Earlier in the episode they tried it on one of the main cast members who knew they were being implanted with a suggestion (to slap someone or jump up and down, depending on the cue) and he broke out in a laughing fit.<p>Also if you want to see priming in the extreme, read about the Milgram Experiment and then about the Strip Search Prank Call Scam.<p>Also I know I'm one of the 1/3 who doesn't react to hypnosis. I'm unsure about hypnotic flooding, but its effects are less certain than normal hypnosis due to the fact that it perverts the results. Incidentally I'm one of the (about 10% of people) who react negatively to sleep meds, they wire me like the energizer bunny.<p>The true effects of priming are the country and state flags sat in the court rooms (this is especially bad in death-penalty cases as national pride usually ups the pro-death vote). What about seeing a guy accused of cop-killing being marched to the stand by two cops?<p>We have to be careful of the unconscious effects of priming we place all around ourselves, because the conscious use of priming in wide civilization will likely have the opposite effect of what we desire.<p>> Of course, you like to think you're above such manipulation-- so does everyone else.<p>I do, as you say everyone does. It's just a mere fact that 1/3 of people are. So you, me and a random person means one of us is above such manipulation.",1239866336
