489223,comment,488705.0,488705.0,0,0,lazyant,,,"I see a potential legal problem with the way the stress test is ""authorized"". The thing is that web server access (putting the ""loadimpact.txt"" file in the server) is not exactly the same as web site ownership.<p>My paranoid mind can think of an scenario like this (INAL so I maybe be off): a web master asks for the load test, this is done and the site goes down for a while, incurring a monetary loss (loss in sales for example). The owner sues the testing company for a 'DoS' and the testing company has no way to prove that it was authorized (what text file, there's none!).<p>I personally wouldn't do a stress test on a server without written authorization of the owner. The way I would implement this on an online service is by asking the target web site and the email address, where this address has to be in the public whois information. Then I'd send a special message to that email address and by replying the owner gives authorization (this way I'd have something from the official email address). This is not a 'written authorization' but comes as close as it can and the whois email address is used for domain transactions etc so it has the same level of protection/legal procedure behind.",1235163465

489214,comment,488688.0,489112.0,0,0,timr,,,"I must have missed the part of Wealth of Nations that you're citing.  Because when I read it, Smith defined ""wealth"" only in aggregate, as the ""net revenues"" of the labor of a society.  So ignoring, for the moment, the fact that Adam Smith's definition of ""wealth"" isn't the only one (and the fact that you're using the terms ""wealth"" and ""value"" interchangeably), I think you've misinterpreted what he wrote.<p>In other words, you're really stretching to use his notion of ""wealth"" as an argument that trade creates more wealth.  Wealth generation does not occur when an item is traded -- it occurs when an item is <i>created</i>, using <i>labor</i>.  Smith goes out of his way to say this:<p><i>""The value of any commodity, ... to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities""</i> (Wealth of Nations, Book 1, chapter V)<p>The peanuts in your example didn't gain or lose value when they were traded for a paperback.  Nor did the paperback gain or lose value.  We merely created a market that defined their values as equivalent.  Confusing this process for wealth creation is a big reason why we're in the economic mess that we're in today.",1235163163

The words of the sacred order must be followed to the letter. They must be swallowed whole without modification.  They are to be held to be applicable to all problems, all contexts, forever, amen.  That is except when they don't apply according to some mysterious unwritten set of rules held by the sacred order.<p>Gad.  I can't count the times I have seen this crap since I started developing software back in the mid 1960'sd.  It started with designing software using an IBM flow chart template.

The place is small, narrow, and limited.  I seriously question that it can make up for lousy programmers and lousy code.

Media which can easily be distributed to millions, including some very sick people. Media which can last a lifetime (or longer)<p>Sure, we smoked pot when we were kids, and we read Playboys too. But nobody has videos of us doing all of that on YouTube. The electronic records problem here is extremely disturbing.<p>With the current FB conflict, I'm sure that most <i>adults</i> don't realize what kind of electronic record they're leaving all over the place, much less their kids. As a society, we've generally tried to protect kids from doing things that could have lifelong consequences. Do we want to give that up?<p>The underlying philosophy is a tricky-wicket. We don't necessarily allow kids to do stuff simply because ""kids will be kids"", i.e., it's natural for them to do it. So while I'm all with the emotion of the article, the underlying issues are a lot trickier than I think the author lets on. You can't just skim over the fact that 30 years from now when you're applying to be Supreme Court Justice that videos of your 14-year-old self doing stupid people sex tricks could be out there circulating. Fair or not, people aren't going to understand.",1235160629

People are losing capex budgets, which depresses forecasts from enterprise technology companies, and they're losing headcount. I don't personally know anyone who's been laid off. But it could take a couple quarters for the F500 to fully react to Q4'08; the budgeting process alone in a normal year consumes months at most of these companies.",1235160358
