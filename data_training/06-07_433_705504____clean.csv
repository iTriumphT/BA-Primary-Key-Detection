Michael Arrington will have, to a close approximation, the entire population of Silicon Valley send him an email today.  Your odds of getting even fleeting attraction are low.  Should you get fleeting attraction, you'll find your site crushed under a wave of looky-loos who will make disparaging comments on everything they can before abandoning it.<p>By comparison, the people you made your application for might actually, you know, want to <i>use</i> it.  Why don't you target their blogs?  Speak to the people you know in their community?  (You do know people in their community, right?  If not, turn off the IDE and go meet some people in their community.)<p>I'd also start your SEO efforts, if you haven't already.  (If you haven't, turn off the IDE and...)  That is a deep subject when starting from nothing, but the short version is think of ways that linking to you will improve the lives of people who don't want to buy your software, then, tell them that.<p>Oh, and this comment is going to sound like a broken record from me, but launch is not a one-time event.  99.9999999% of people who see your site will not see it on launch day.  For someone who comes in on day 4 or day 40 or day 4,000, your site JUST launched.  Optimize for their experience, not Michael Arrington's.",1264316023

Similarly, though less bureaucratically, there are plenty of other dropouts working here at Google leading awesome projects, despite the 'must come from a top school or have a PhD' image it has.<p>It's cheesy, but in all such cases, I've seen that the biggest hurdle was getting over the ""no you can't because you don't have X"", either by trying harder, or by having someone else show you the way (or by dumb luck, in my case).",1264314719

All else being equal, yes, personal crusades are a distraction, but he's only human.  The type of commitment necessary to succeed in a startup isn't necessarily 80 hours a week with a laser focus.  It's hard enough to keep most people focused for a solid 40 hours a week.  And also, it's very easy to appear totally dedicated but actually be mentally spinning your wheels and not performing well for a variety of reasons.  I mean, you maybe right, but I just think it's hard to judge by looking at outside indicators like what someone rants about.",1264314466

He would much prefer a more simple method like this where it would be harder for errors to occur and avoid lengthy audits. He makes much less from those government audits than from other type work.<p>The complexity of the Tax code is also stupid. A lot of it could be simplified but that would eliminate government jobs quickly. Accountants won't care, there's a lot of lucrative work that still needs be done. In fact, most tax returns aren't done by CPA (or CA in Canada) anyway. H&R Block and others might be pissed and try to block this but they charge too much anyway.",1264314006

The Clayton Act (and specifically 15 U.S.C. section 14 on tying), like other antitrust laws in this country, requires that the tying either create a monopoly or ""substantially lessen competition...in any line of commerce"". Simply lessening competition is not illegal, it has to be on the scale of affecting the entire line of commerce, aka relevant market.<p><a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/14.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/14.html</a><p>If a court decides that in dealing with App Store sales, we're talking about the software market, then the App Store is such a tiny piece of the software market that literally no policy they set can SUBSTANTIALLY lessen competition in the entire market. It's a private company so they're free to set whatever policies they want. If they want to tie their browser to their phone and prevent you from using anyone else's browser, that's completely legal.<p>A court would have to really stretch and define something very narrow, like a smartphone application market, to even begin arguing any antitrust case.",1264313433

1073049,comment,1072599.0,1072979.0,0,0,wallflower,,,"Eighteen years. Wow. You are basically a professional dancer. Professional dancers should be able to 1) be able to perform or compete at a high level 2) teach and 3) dance socially.<p>One thing I left out in my earlier comments is the people who have been dancing for a long time can inadvertently intimidate newbies - particularly for ballroom - because at the dance club they see these really experienced dancers glide across the floor - and they think - how can I dance with these people who are so good and/or dance on the same floor. The nicer dancers will ask newbies to dance because they remember when they were starting out, in simultaneous awe and intimidation.<p>Another dance hack, especially for Latin dancing, is understanding the structure of the music so that you can predict changes in the music with good probability.<p>For example, in Salsa music, listen for a change in the music, count 8 measures and anticipate a break, and if there is no break, count another 8 (16 total) and anticipate the break. Sometimes it gets to 24 before there is a break and followers love it when you can predict these breaks (dance to the music).<p>It is actually a lot, lot harder to do this when you are social dancing and trying to protect your follower (crowded dance floor) - but it is doable.<p>The other part is tempo changes - vary the speed of your moves to the tempo and feel of the music. Slow things down, speed things up.",1264313112
