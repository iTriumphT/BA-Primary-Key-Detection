461885,comment,461756.0,461756.0,0,0,glymor,,,The problem with these systems is they don't know what is significant state so they have to copy everything to the slave.<p>The way Remus gets round this is it bulk copies (upto 40 times a second) rather than on every change. So the master runs slightly ahead.<p>Terracotta is something similar for the JVM. I think they get round it by exploiting the fact the JVM knows what's going on so for example you could say I want only this field on a class to be replicated. (But I've never used terracotta so someone might have to correct me on that.),1233550663

461881,comment,461296.0,461296.0,0,0,astrodust,,,"The trouble with trying to cross-fund ventures like that is it might diffuse the focus of your business. The way you succeed is by doing what you do best, which is ideally better than the competition and something that's in demand.<p>I'd say you're faced with a few ways of raising capital, one of which is investing in a porn site. While web sites may be web sites, I'd suggest that running an adult-themed one is more problematic than most because people will always think themselves clever and try and crack their way in past your pay-wall. Without the right precautions, this could take a fair bit of time to either set up or, in the case of breeches, to patch up the compromised accounts.<p>If you don't want to get directly involved, you might want to consider exploring what you can do to make money from that sort of thing without running a site yourself. For example, this friend of yours may need some technology developed for their properties, and as you have many developers on hand, it could be trivial to crank out something like that for profit without impacting your other project too badly.<p>That way you get better at doing what you're best at, such as development, without getting distracted over the long-term with other side projects.",1233550328

461853,comment,461791.0,461791.0,0,0,TooMuchNick,,,"This also answers my longest-standing question about cafes: Why are there so few fun ones?<p>San Francisco's Valencia Street (with its immediate offshoots) supports hundreds of interesting businesses. Many of them are cafes. Only two of those cafes are any good: Ritual Roasters, and Four Barrel. Four Barrel was founded last year by a disgruntled co-founder of Ritual.<p>While the rest of Valencia's cafes are grimy, poorly lit, deathly quiet, or all of the above, RR and FB are sunny, friendly, and <i>loud</i>. That noise is all the foot traffic (and some David Bowie). The people sitting in Ritual for five hours on a laptop aren't paying the (staggeringly high) rent. It's the constant in-and-out of to-go cups. Mercifully, Four Barrel has no wifi and thus a more talkative, flowing crowd.<p>Ironically, because RR and FB have coffee that makes people come and go quickly, they can afford to make a pleasant space for people who stick around. Their solution to cafe economics was to make their own high-markup product.<p>Of course there are other solutions. Cafe du Soleil in the Lower Haight offers an extensive sandwich menu and gets its baked goods as part of a chain of boutique cafes and restaurants called the Bay Bread Group, which also sells bread to bigger clients like the Ritz Carlton. For all I know, Soleil is riding on the profits of the Bay Bread Group as an indulgent loss leader.<p>But I suppose there's a lesson there for any startup with a boutique aspect: Make your own supplies, and you might have a business plan to support your dream.

461852,comment,461296.0,461296.0,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I have no moral qualms with it, but I wouldn't because it's just not a good investment. In my travels I've bumped into some people who've succeeded at it (one of whom writes a fascinating blog about the industry) and it's not easy.<p>For one, there's serious capital outlay. Producing porn is not cheap. Good female performers charge $1k-$2k per scene. Males are $300-$500, but significantly less reliable. They're really more important too, since their job is much more demanding. Thanks to lubricants, a female can pretty much phone it in so any hot model will do. But good luck finding a guy who will show up, not be coked out, and be able to get it up and keep it up, and pop when and where you tell him to. You're going to have entire shoots largely wasted due to this.<p>You have to rent locations, camera men, lighting people. You're easily looking at $4k-$5k per scene. To get people to pay money, top sites put out 10 or more scenes per week. Can you fund this until reach the critical mass needed to break even? If so I suspect you wouldn't be considering doing this in the first place.<p>You have to move to L.A. pretty much. That's where all of the adult modeling agencies are, and California is the only state in which shooting a porn does not constitute illegal prostitution.<p>You have to design the web software, which is not trivial. You're delivering videos so your incremental costs are high. You have to deal with payments, which usually means a very expensive third-party provider. The rake is high because of the very high rate of charge backs (which usually occur when the wife sees the charge on the monthly statement and the husband suddenly can't determine what it is and decides its bogus) which in turn makes credit card companies often decline those purchases, so the processors play a game of cat and mouse (much like companies that process payments to casinos, which is how I know this part) by changing their business names and category codes. In fact, you need multiple processors, because each one on its own will fail a large portion of the time. It wouldn't be worth your time to try to process payments yourself.<p>You have to set up and run an affiliate program, which is the main way these sites get traffic. That will require networking with some of the millions of free sites. You have to find a good way of getting content to them, running promotions. The major sites pay up to 70% in affiliate fees.<p>People tend to think that because the industry is unsavory, it therefore is less competitive, but really the opposite is true. Just like selling drugs is way more competitive than selling tires (to my knowledge Goodyear employees don't run drivebys on local Firestone plants) porn is way more competitive than most other industries.",1233548254
