So what happens if we go back further?<p>There is a paper [1] which uses data from several other studies to reconstruct temperature deviations at 20 different global locations over a 2000-year period. It argues that the statistical methods used in other paleoclimate models are flawed, and uses a different statistical method which concludes that, in the absence of tree ring data, the Medieval Warm Period (approx. 950 a.d. to 1250 a.d.) was warmer than the current century.<p>I don't have the necessary background in statistics to be able to analyze the two different methods. However, even if we take that paper at face value, 2000-year data is still not geologically significant.<p>So, we turn to Antarctic ice cores. Specifically, data from the Vostok ice core sample shows a clear 150,000 year warming and cooling cycle, going back about 400,000 years ago (with increasing uncertainty).<p>At first glance, someone might think that this is damning evidence in the case for AGW. However, the recent thousand year period is a mere blip on a graph stretching back 400,000 years, so it's difficult to see the part that has climate scientists really concerned:<p>The amount of CO2 currently in the atmosphere, and reconstructed over the last thousand years, is dramatically greater than at any other point in the last 400,000 years. Specifically, CO2 concentrations have peaked at around 300 ppmv during the 150,000 year cycle, but are currently at around 383 ppmv.<p>To put this in perspective, the difference between the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere now, versus the amount in the peaks of the last 400,000 years, is close to the same as the difference between the peaks and the troughs.<p>So while the Earth clearly does have its own warming and cooling cycle, we have induced a dramatic change in the cycle, which should lead to some interesting results.<p>(Further reading: ""Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years"", free download at <a href=""http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11676"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11676</a>)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.ncasi.org/publications/Detail.aspx?id=3025"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncasi.org/publications/Detail.aspx?id=3025</a>",1259848771

If your LinkedIn profile is a reflection of your current resume, there's a fair amount you can cut from that if you need to make room. Things like ""Tool was eventually taken up by QA team"" isn't terribly relevant, and the BCCampus Research Assistant unfortunately sounds a bit like fluff.<p>* Don't expect anyone to have given your resume more than a cursory overview. Instead, plan on that and make sure that your most important bullet points stand out on the page. You can do this by re-ordering your information or by varying your whitespace, verbs used, and sentence length.<p>* Think about implementing a template from <a href=""http://www.oswd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oswd.org/</a> for your personal website. You may not have design skills (and even those majoring in design often lack them out of college), but at least show you can recognize good design and follow directions by implementing one of the free templates there<p>* I normally hate to flaunt my own stuff, but I wrote an article recently on some of my personal pet peeves on resumes - <a href=""http://citizenparker.com/post/Spray-and-Pray-Developer-Resumes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citizenparker.com/post/Spray-and-Pray-Developer-Resum...</a><p>I would be happy to give your resume a more in-depth review and follow-up with you personally.

When asked a question, tell a story about how you solved a problem (which is why you're there) While telling it, listen closely for clues that you have touched on something of value.

I think you've focussed on intentions of particular parties in the scenarios rather than the net market and that this has taken you to an incorrect conclusion.<p>With scalpers, the venue venue has their risk removed (they lock in their sales early), and the scalpers increase liquidity by removing the venue's monopoly power over pricing the event. And price discover is better.<p>Now either the consumers are able to buy the tickets from the scalpers in a competitive market (and often with increased convenience), or the scalper can destroy the tickets and nobody can turn up the the event. They generally won't - that's irrational. Even if they did - it's not an ineficiency for the purpose of the original marketplace. In fact, it creates opportunity for extra production: the venue can arrange a late-entry-for-unfilled-spot policy which allows them to get people in and sell some tickets twice.<p>Or the venue can detect scalpers and create a dynamic price market of their own and maximise their volumes.<p>In the situation where multiple scalpers get the tickets and plan to sell them, there has been a massive gain in efficiency. The scalpers have removed the venue's monopoly power over ticket prices and created a second market place which will have more effective price discovery.<p>Either way, the event provider is focussing on what they're good at, and the scalpers at what they're good at.<p>Scalping is entreprenerial in spirit and good for the system in practice.",1259847270

Even if 100-percent test coverage (see RE3) were possible, that criteria would be insufficient for testing. Roughly 35 percent of software defects emerge from missing logic paths, and another 40 percent are from the execution of a unique combination of logic paths. They will not be caught by 100-percent coverage (100-percent coverage can, therefore, potentially detect only about 25 percent of the errors!).</i><p>Given the fanaticism for TDD today, this is a fact well worth remembering.",1259845493

When they tell people about the anchoring heuristic, people still continue to make similar mistakes.<p>One way to explain would be to think about the number of variables we should account for in virtually any everyday decision. Finding even a fairly optimal solution would consume too many resources and evolution has taught us to deal with this using emotional shortcuts. On the evolutionary time scale, the 50 years when the question of choosing a programming language was relevant would be a tiny dot.<p>On the other hand, rational knowledge <i>can</i> by absorbed subconsciousness eventually.
