I did google to see what the other side says about this and found this interesting:<p>""Human-designed devices, such as radios and computers, do not need to function until their assembly is complete. By contrast, living organisms must function to a high degree in order to thrive during every developmental stage from a single-cell zygote to adult. The embryo as a whole must be a fully functioning system in its specific environment during every second of its entire development. For this reason, adult anatomy can be understood only in the light of development.""<p><a href=""http://www.icr.org/article/recurrent-laryngeal-nerve-not-evidence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icr.org/article/recurrent-laryngeal-nerve-not-evi...</a><p>I do not vouch for the science behind either article, but the concept that everything must work all the time rather than only at completion is an interesting concept that shows the difference between things I make and how I was made.",1306677588

The ability to make literary references in a few words is a basic aspect of literacy. I suppose their brains are probably crowded with internet memes and celebrity facts and have no space for this sort of more beautiful trivia. Something I love about geeks is that their big brains tend to retain more references like this, so when they talk and listen they can use the whole language, including classic literature.",1306675284

You can mutate classes at runtime, and even replace the class of an instance at runtime, OTOH Python cannot do the slot lookup optimization you speak of, due to its dynamical nature. Python shows that class-based inheritance is very useful (and easy to use) in a dynamic language.",1306675266

2596566,comment,2594521.0,2596545.0,10,0,jashkenas,,,"Yep, you've got that all about right.<p>There are a couple of fine points: In JS, using regular constructors, object slot lookups still tend to be O(1)-ish -- engines like V8 optimize the ""hidden class"" of the object by assuming that all instances share the same rough shape, with guard checks if you start to change your properties dynamically later.<p>Also, regular constructors in JS are much more memory-efficient than the popular alternative ""module pattern"", which looks like this:<p><pre><code>    var makePoint = function() {\n      var x, y;\n      return {\n        getX: function(){ ... },\n        getY: function(){ ... },\n        distance: function(){ ... }\n      };\n    };\n\n    var point = makePoint();\n</code></pre>\nBecause functions in JS are mutable objects with their own identity, guess what happens each time you create a point? You've just duplicated every function that the point uses as a method, including their closure. It gobbles up memory to the point where you can't make more than a few thousand instances of <i>any</i> object, no matter how small.<p>With ""new Point"", in JS, there's only ever one copy of the point's functions in use -- living on Point.prototype -- and all this is avoided.<p>Finally, class-based OO can be fully dynamic these days, it just depends on how you want to implement it: see Ruby, where any object can have a ""metaclass"" with its own complement of methods.",1306674571

It doesn't really add much.
