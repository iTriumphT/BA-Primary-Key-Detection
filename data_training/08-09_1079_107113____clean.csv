Keynesiansim is not &#x27;lots of government spending&#x27; its about increasing spending in case of AD shortfall.<p>Now that might be millitary spending but that only works in a limited set of cases.<p>But the basic idea is of course often used as a excuse by lots of people.

You could tell he just wanted to be something other than a dev (which he admitted to afterwards). I mean he knew how to do it, it wasn&#x27;t a complex task (read a file, compare it to a DB, show the differences). But after many weeks of zero progress, I decided enough was enough. I think he was relieved.<p>- Pleasant: I call my remaining dev into the office.<p>Me: &quot;So, you know what&#x27;s going on in the company, right?&quot;<p>Dev:  Smiling, almost laughing his head off: &quot;Yeah haha, I can&#x27;t believe the boss blew that much money in a few weeks.

Anyway, gotta can everyone else now...&quot;<p>We even did the old Alan Sugar &quot;You&#x27;re Fired!&quot; routine from the Apprentice on one guy, causing much laughter.<p>- Absolutely shocking. So, the boss has hired a new trader, and he&#x27;s coming towards the end of his probation period (3 months typically in the UK). Boss goes on holiday, and runs into a guy who says he knows this person, and comes up with some hearsay that is totally not checkable. Calls his junior managers (I was away), makes us can him right before the deadline. Lawyer tells us not to say anything at all about why he&#x27;s being canned. Obviously, the guy wants to know why, but it&#x27;s not like the reason makes any sense, and the lawyer of course doesn&#x27;t want us sued. Dude goes red, appeals to common decency, starts shouting, but no. Just silence. I&#x27;m still annoyed about this thing. I never even got to say goodbye or any chance to tell him after the firm went down the toilet.

Armando Ianucci (the writer) has straight up stated that he won&#x27;t write any more The Thick Of It until he feels he has material worthy of new episodes.<p>I think it&#x27;s the US networks putting pressure on writers to produce produce produce which ends up being the difference between the perfection of The Thick Of It and the greatness of Veep (in my opinion).",1424248281

Its certainly very encouraging.<p>The premise of the company is to help organizations identify the high risk patients so that their physicians can spend more time and effort on providing better care and coordination. We are addressing this by using insightful and actionable data. The physicians and organizations that are using our system are  making efforts to make costs more manageable for patients.<p>Our algorithms help predict readmission rates, comorbidity, and financial outcomes using evidence backed data and statistics from renowned institutions. In the end, we are not looking to remove physicians from the equation, nor are we replacing EMRs. Rather we are augmenting both with our actionable insights. When healthcare organizations are managing an entire population health, it provides opportunities for errors or sometimes even gaps in care. This is where we are looking to improve the process for physician organizations and hospital groups.<p>I hope these comments were useful. And I would love to talk to you individually.

I dont see the obvious answer<p>So, your intuition is right in a sense and wrong in a sense.<p>You are right in that AI systems probably won&#x27;t really have the &quot;emotion of wanting&quot;, why would it just happen to have this emotion, when you can imagine plenty of minds without it.<p>However, if we want an AI system to be autonomous, we&#x27;re going to have to give it a goal, such as &quot;maximize this objective function&quot;, or something along those lines. Even if we don&#x27;t explicitly write in a goal, an AI has to interact with the real world, and thus would have to affect it. Imagine an AI who is just a giant glorified calculator, but who is allowed to purchase its own AWS instances. At some point, it may realize that &quot;oh, if I use those AWS instances to start simulating this thing and sending out these signals, I get more money to purchase more AWS!&quot;. Notice at no point was this hypothetical AI explicitly given a goal, but it nevertheless started exhibiting &quot;goallike&quot; behavior.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that an AI would get an &quot;addiction&quot; that way, but it suggests that anything smart is hard to predict, and that getting their goals &quot;right&quot; in the first place is much better than leaving it up to chance.<p>> How would an AI get addicted? Why wouldn&#x27;t it research addiction and fix itself to no longer be addicted? That is behavior i would expect from an intelligence greater than our own, rather than indulgence<p>This is my bad for using such a loaded term. By &quot;addiction&quot; I mean that the AI &quot;wants&quot; something, and it finds that humans are inadequate to give it to them. Which leads me to...<p>> Why in the world would it do this? Why wouldn&#x27;t it just generate digital images of cats on its own?<p>Because you humans have all of these wasteful and stupid desires such as &quot;happiness&quot;, &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;love&quot; and so have factories that produce video games, iphones and chocolate. Sure I may have the entire internet already producing cat pictures as fast as its processors could run, but imagine if I could make the internet 100 times bigger by destroying all non-computer things and turning them into cat cloning vats, cat camera factories and hardware chips optimized for detecting cats?<p>Analogously, imagine you were an ant. You could mount all sorts of convincing arguments about how humans already have all the aphids they want, about how they already have perfectly functional houses, but you, as a human, would still pave over billions of ant colonies for shaving 20 minutes off a commute. It&#x27;s not that we&#x27;re being intentionally wasteful and conquering of the ants. We just don&#x27;t care about them and we&#x27;re much more powerful than them.<p>Hence the AI safety risk is: By default an AI doesn&#x27;t care about us, and will use our resources for whatever it wants, so we better create a version which <i>does</i> care about us.<p>Also cross thread, you mentioned that organic intelligences have many multi-dimensional goals. The reason why AI goals could be very weird is that it doesn&#x27;t have to be organic; it could have an only one dimensional goal, such as cat picture. It could have similar dimension goals but be completely different, like the perverse desire to maximize the number of divorces in the universe.",1424246822

A good firing is one where the manager has laid out the problem long in advance and given the employee the opportunity to fix it. (Some will argue that being put on a &quot;plan&quot; is just HR cover and that the firing is imminent, but that certainly wasn&#x27;t the case with me. I wanted them to improve.) In general, my philosophy is that any true firing (non layoff) should be easy for the employee to see coming a mile away. If not, then you&#x27;re not communicating well.<p>If you&#x27;ve told a guy &quot;look, you&#x27;re a salesperson and you need to make X calls per day&quot; and then they don&#x27;t make those calls, well then you&#x27;ve given them a chance and they blew it. They knew they blew it and so the subsequent firing is both understandable and foreseeable.<p>My own firing came out of nowhere and made no sense. 6 weeks prior I&#x27;d been given a raise. It was so egregious and personal, the manager himself was fired a few months later. Possibly the most flabbergasting part is that the company was scared to hire me back due to fears id harbor a grusge, gather evidence and sue them for something else later (which wasn&#x27;t true). The whole thing was shocking and confusing to the point that I went through the stages of grief. It also shattered my faith that the world works in predictable ways: if you&#x27;re a loyal, hard worker with a great performance record, you have nothing to worry about. Suddenly that safety was just gone. In subsequent jobs, no matter how well they say I&#x27;m doing, I feel I could be axed at any moment. It&#x27;s a horrible feeling. I have very real scars from it. (Obviously.)<p>So in other words, these are human beings. They deserve an explanation. They deserve a chance to do better (if it&#x27;s performance related) and maybe they deserve a sincere apology for bringing them into a position that isn&#x27;t working put like both parties had hoped.<p>So yes, and this is very personal to me, there are good and bad ways to do it. Anyone who says otherwise shouldn&#x27;t be employing or managing anyone.",1424246765

The most usual case I&#x27;ve seen is that you have to let the employee go for performance reasons but you still have a good relationship with him and it&#x27;s pretty natural to help by a) telling what was wrong and what he could improve in his new job and b) offering help to find a new job/talk to his prospective employers about what he did do right. I would even argue that even the most selfish managers should still proceed that way, since ending a relationship on a (as much as possible) positive note decreases the risk of a lawsuit afterwards.",1424246676
