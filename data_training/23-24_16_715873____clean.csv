It's a short, readable book on pricing ""for dummies"" by Richard McKenzie (UC Irvine).<p>I have zero formal training in economics, and I found the book enlightening. It discusses price discrimination thoroughly - after all, it's a critical component of pricing theory.<p>I, too, find the thought of one buyer paying more simply because s/he can afford the price somehow ""wrong"". I don't fully buy the explanation in the book (mainly revolving around time opportunity costs, as I see it). But, at the same time, life is not always fair - morality and money are orthogonal to some extent. If this behavior were deemed harmful by society, surely it would be illegal by now?<p>[Edit: Minor Engrish nit.]",1247443059
