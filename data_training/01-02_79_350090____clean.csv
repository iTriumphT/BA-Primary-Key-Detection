I have been a fairly active user for the past 2 years or so, both commenting on and submitting content to reddit.  When I joined I was fleeing digg's transformation into a 4chan wannabe.  Over the past 6-9 months, I've been noticing the same virus, if you will, infecting reddit.  The users became more and more meme obsessed, less interested in reading stuff they don't know and more interested in repeating what they already know.  I finally looked at the front page the other day and realized there wasn't one article that I viewed had any intellectual value.  Yes, I know if I want something specific I can go to individual subreddits, but even most of those has been infected to the point where some users are creating their own academic hideaways on reddit in order to preserve the original reddit intellectualism that once strived (e.g. /r/depthhub).<p>This is not something reddit can fix, and I fear that reddit will meet the same fate that digg has recently met.  Both digg and reddit gained users at a steady pace, then skyrocketed in users and plummeted in intellectual value.  On both sites users complained about how the site had changed but no one listened or cared.  Eventually, as all the intellectually curious users left, the users that remained realized they are no better than 4chan and began looking for a new home as well.  I believe this is an inevitable cycle for all social news websites.  I wouldn't be surprised if in a few years I am fleeing Hacker News for the same reason.<p>I'd love to hear what some of the reddit admins think about how reddit has changed over the years, seeing as you all have had a better perspective than anyone else on reddit's evolution.<p>Good luck monetizing reddit, I will most likely donate some to show my appreciation for all reddit has provided me for the last couple of years.",1278727019

The first point was, it can be seen as reasonable to die to help your children. The second point is my stipulation that to say it's only <i>ever</i> reasonable in the case that your children are in mortal danger is silly.<p>If you value your life very low (for example, you are bedridden in the hospital, terminally ill, on the verge of death and will be in excruciating pain for the rest of your short life) and the well-being of your children very high, why is that so crazy? Soldiers in a country being invaded can go to war and die to protect their families from enslavement, rape, pillaging, and so forth, not just from death, and no one (well, usually) criticizes and demeans them for that. Are soldiers the only ones allowed to do that?<p>I can sense you're balking at the part money plays in the equation, and you do not like when money is assigned value beyond pieces of paper. Consider that the people making these decisions are likely not thinking of the dollar amount of the inheritance. I would bet they are thinking of the amount of good (whether getting lots of money = good can be debated, but let's assume it does, or at least assume they believe it does) they can do for their children when they pass. Being taxed on that money means giving up a lot of that good.",1278726545

1502811,comment,1502132.0,1502688.0,0,0,cjy,,,"It seems there are two issues here:  a moral one and a pragmatic one. [edit grammar]<p>1.  Moral Issue:  Does society have some claim to the wealth that is created by the most successful members of that society?  This is a complicated issue.  When we are talking about natural monopolies due to network externalities I might agree with this. Mark Zuckerberg hasn't created billions of dollars of value.  Facebook is valuable because everyone uses it.  Zuckerberg just created a marginally better website marginally quicker than the next guy.<p>However, it is inane to say that  ""every fortune depends as much on society as it does on the individual.""  That's selling creators short.  There is a scarcity of people who create things; people with vision who can make that vision a reality.  People who create great things should have a right to the fruits of their labor.  They should have a right to share those fruits with their loved ones.<p>2.  Practical Issue:  We want to put the incentives in place to encourage people to create wealth and produce things.  You argue that wealth inequalities distort economic incentives, but I think the arguments for that are pretty questionable.  See my post on guard labor.\n<a href=""http://aspiringeconomist.com/index.php/2010/02/04/guard-labor-why-is-inequality-bad/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aspiringeconomist.com/index.php/2010/02/04/guard-labo...</a><p>Taxes are bad because they distort people’s behavior.  We want to raise revenue for society by taxing people who won't change their behavior in response to taxes.  See Ramsey Optimal taxes.  So the question is: are estate taxes a good way to tax people without discouraging them from working as much?  It's an empirical question I don't know the answer to.  I do know that the estate tax encourages people to spend lot of time and resources trying to get out of paying taxes (trusts, offshore accounts, consulting lawyers).

David Beazley ran some numbers on a simple benchmark than indicated that running the same program with two threads on two CPUs was <i>twice as slow</i> than running the same program on a single thread on one CPU.  It's not just a matter of not being able to use extra cores: the GIL actively slows down the other threads through context-switching overhead:<p><a href=""http://blip.tv/file/2232410"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blip.tv/file/2232410</a><p>Also, the serialization introduced by the GIL hurts worst when you're gluing together complex applications.  Say that you have a finely-tuned C++ app that spends about 20% of its time in an embedded Python interpreter (number chosen to make the math easy).  Now you make the C++ multithreaded and run it on four cores.  The 80% of the CPU time spent in C++ gets parallelized effectively, so now it's only 20% of the original runtime.  But the Python access is all serialized by the GIL, so it's still 20% of the original time, or <i>50%</i> of the new runtime.  At this point, you're highly likely to get thread contention issues between different threads attempting to acquire the GIL (as per the video), so your Python performance goes down even more - which makes thread contention even more likely, and so on.<p>By contrast, if you'd rewritten the Python in Haskell, the most you could get was a 25% speedup, because most of the execution time was spent in C++ anyway.",1278724916

Most historical dictatorships have been based on the simple principle of compound interest. In Britain two thirds of our land is still owned by just 6,000 people, most of them aristocrats. I think any American would be a fool to forget that their nation was founded as a rejection of British serfdom, and that their nation is perhaps the only one in history that has not lived under the tyranny of oligarchy. It seems to me to be no coincidence that America is almost unique in the world in not having a common cultural sense that economic wealth inevitably translates into political power.<p>For a contemporary example of the perils of unearned wealth, we need look no further than Russia - in less than two decades it has descended to a state of pure plutocracy, based on little more than unchecked accumulation of wealth and simple corruption. Those opposing campaign finance laws and regulation of that sort would be wise to look at the career of Vladimir Putin as a cautionary example of what happens when wealth is allowed to dominate democracy.<p>I consider myself a classic liberal, on largely utilitarian grounds - I believe that a free market is good for us all and that any regulation of that market is likely to do more harm than good. However, I fail to see the harm done to society by considering a dead person's assets to be essentially 'dead money', beyond that which is necessary to sustain his family. If you truly wish to have a lasting influence on the world after your death, trust laws give you ample opportunity to leave a permanent economic legacy. The likes of Gates, Buffet, Carnegie and Rockefeller seem to recognise this. I fail to see what good comes of inheritance, but do see a long history of great wrongs resulting from it.

They exist in memory, and ""killing them"" removes them from memory, but that doesn't affect battery life.<p>Now, if you install every app from the Market and don't use them, then that can be a problem, because some apps do run in the background.  But that is a very special case.  Things like Maps, Browser, etc., aren't eating your battery life.  Things like updating Twitter every 30 seconds are.

So the GC algorithm killed peoples' homescreens when they loaded a big app, and they assumed that background tasks were causing that.  They killed something like ""Maps"", switched to a tiny app, and noticed that their homescreen didn't get killed anymore, so clearly Task Managers are necessary.<p>Oh well, sometimes a feeling of control is enough to make you feel less bad about having shitty hardware, so I guess task killers are good for that reason.",1278724559
