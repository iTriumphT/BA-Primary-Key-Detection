So there could be a lot books set in the harry potter world, but fans would only buy those by the author that they like.  I realize that the author has a much better system today, but in reality it should no longer exist.  For instance, how long should we be banned from writing books in the Harry Potter universe? 10 yeas, 20 years, forever?<p>As for your photography example, someone taking your photograph and using it wouldn't be able to say that they took it.  That would be fraud.  If they listed the credits for the picture you would be credited.  Now of course it would be great if 20000$ were deposited in your checking account, and I'd love it if the law allowed me to charge people walking on the street in front of my house for the pleasure my house gives them, but I can't.<p>So yes copyright is a problem it restricts what I can do with ideas, not with physical property.  My use of ideas and data that you've transferred to me does not limit you in any way you can still do everything that you could before.  The entire concept of intellectual property is fundamentally flawed, and it was able to exist when the means of copying material were expensive, now that it is cheap the flaws are beginning to show and the advantages content creators have been given is going to go away.  Imagine if you had to ask permission and pay licensee fees anytime you photographed something that was designed by a human.

1239814,comment,1238849.0,1239756.0,0,0,jrockway,,,"Nothing special.  Everything happens in some instance of MonadError and MonadState; error for aborting when there is some problem, and state for logging. (Why not writer for logging?  After a week of playing with various levels of strictness over Writer, with the help of #haskell, I couldn't get any variant of writer to not use all my stack space.  Dropping in State fixed the problem.  I know why State fixed the problem, but I don't know why I couldn't make Writer strict enough.  Oh well.)<p>Unlike with most logging, I don't really care to see the results as the process is running; the log is just a list of failed sanity checks that may indicate problems with the data.  It just gets printed at the end, and I can check out the datasets that are suspicious when I feel like it.<p>Thanks to Catch and some wrappers I have that turn IO errors into Lefts, I know that my process isn't going to die halfway through.  My only worry is possible data corruption because some assumption is violated, so if I see anything weird, I make a note and continue.  If something is clearly wrong, then that dataset is Left instead of Right, and is skipped.<p>I also have a function that downgrades Lefts to Right + a warning, so I can have a few failures in the ETL run and worry about those after the non-error sets are processed.<p>The actual scripts just read config data from a file or the command-line, and run some function that actually does the work.  These are named something like theFooProcess/Main.hs, and are built into executables like ""theFooProcess.exe"" with Cabal.  (I also build the library code as a separate Cabal target, but I don't have any projects that refer to each other yet, so this really just wastes my time during compilation.  Heh.)<p>(Oh yeah, did I mention that my processes are all Windows-based because the third-party libraries are Windows-only?  Yeah.  But GHC handles it great!  Emacs + ghci + cabal on Windows is exactly like Emacs + ghci + cabal on UNIX.  With Haskell, Windows is not much of a problem... except for the security updates that reboot my machines in the middle of ETL runs :)",1270359032

Although I want to agree with it, I do so only because I think of ""structure"" as the basic idea behind the school day: you go to class for six to eight hours, divided into chunks of about an hour each and by subject, and then you go home. As near as I can tell, that's been the basic form of school since the formalization of public education.<p>But one could easily be talking about structure as something else, like the way teachers are hired and paid.<p>One problem with the idea of reforming a school's ""grammar"" is that a) schools are so vast and b) the stakeholders in schools, most notably teachers and their unions, have a greater stake in schools than any other. That's one reason I linked to all the articles here: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2009/11/12/susan-engel-doesnt-get"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2009/11/12/susan-engel-doesnt-get</a> in a post on how ""Susan Engel doesn’t get the problems with schools, but she’ll tell us to “Teach Your Teachers Well” anyway."" The problems with public education are largely structural, but probably have more to do with the way teachers are rewarded and incentivized than any other factor. At least that's what the educational research of the last decade or so seems to show.<p>Although you <i>might</i> over time be able to change that, I'm not sure you'll be able to change everything. For example, lots of people complain (justifiably) about grade inflation and other aspects that are problematic about grades. But what are you supposed to do instead? There's not anything major or obvious, as discussed here: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2010/02/17/the-validity-of-grades"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2010/02/17/the-validity-of-grades</a> .",1270358851

It's my first serious project with Clojure on the GAE although I've been playing around with it since last summer.<p>(1) On GAE you don't get to use some of the good parts of Clojure because you can't spawn any threads.  So the rationale for Clojure has to be something else than agents and the Clojure concurrency model. I'd say use Clojure if you want functional programming and all of the Lispy goodness: code as data, macros...<p>For me Lispyness is a huge + so it was a no brainer.<p>(2) One of the things I really like about traditional Clojure web-development (using Ring or Compojure) is that if you set things up properly you can experiment with and patch a live system using the REPL.  I haven't been able to set that up just yet on the GAE.<p>On your development server using the GAE jars, however, you can do it (see <a href=""http://www.hackers-with-attitude.com/2009/08/intertactive-programming-with-clojure.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hackers-with-attitude.com/2009/08/intertactive-pr...</a> for some guidance).  There is nothing like being a C-c C-c away from updating your development server app :)<p>I can't emphasize enough taking the time to get Slime, your GAE development server, lein, and Clojure well-integrated. Your development cycle will make good ol' Java GAE development using the Eclipse plug-in (which I used to think was pretty sweet) feel really really clunky.<p>(See also <a href=""http://elhumidor.blogspot.com/2009/04/clojure-on-google-appengine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elhumidor.blogspot.com/2009/04/clojure-on-google-appe...</a> for some pointers on setting up Clojure on GAE)<p>(3) GAE's datastore works extremely well with Clojure because it's schema-less.  You can store arbitrary hashmaps and structmaps in GAE with zero effort -- it's a match made in heaven.  There are a couple of branches of appengine-clj (<a href=""http://github.com/duelinmarkers/appengine-clj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/duelinmarkers/appengine-clj</a> is the original, <a href=""http://github.com/r0man/appengine-clj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/r0man/appengine-clj</a> is a pretty good branch)  that you can look at to get a feel what I mean.<p>(4) With GAE's transaction support and automatic index generation (it's good enough most of the time), you can dynamically create types (kinds), put them in the datastore, and query on them without having to do any of the traditional NoSQL stuff (thinking queries first, denormalizing ahead of time, etc.).  It's very sweet.  I've done some Clojure+Cassandra and Clojure+GAE is a lot more painless (as long as you can live with the other limitations of the GAE) -- although things are getting much easier in Cassandra world with Hector + automatic index generators.<p>(5) In terms of performance and robustness, nothing about Clojure's held me up.  But since I haven't launched yet, that doesn't mean anything.<p>I don't know of any ""high-traffic"" Clojure+GAE apps out there -- if there are any, I'd love to get some numbers on costs (CPU, especially) to see if there is a significant difference with similar java projects.<p>(Actually, the guys behind <a href=""https://the-deadline.appspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://the-deadline.appspot.com</a>, see <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/smartrevolution/how-a-clojure-pet-project-turned-into-a-fullblown-cloudcomputing-webapp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/smartrevolution/how-a-clojure-pet-...</a>, just launched three days ago -- you may want to shoot them an email, they seem nice enough)<p>My guess is that this is a non-issue.  Clojure holds up really well against Java and JVM languages like Scala in terms of performance (especially if you give type-hints), and I'd expect the same thing to be true on GAE.<p>(6) General Clojure limitation with web development: Clojure web frameworks are light.  You don't get to start with anything as nice as Scala's Lift.  You'll have to work and build your own tools -- the good thing is that Clojure is a blast and macros will, in the longer term, allow you to do much cooler stuff.<p>Compojure is a great light framework to start with.  Also look at Enlive for templating.<p>On the flip-side Clojure immutable nature works very naturally with request / response.<p>(7) For the OP: before you get on GAE, spend some time reading about its limitations:<p>- exploding indexes (makes implementing text search very tough -- there is some irony in there I think)<p>- no threads (it kills me, I want to use pmap)<p>- not real message queues.  GAE is a pull/request-based system, not a push system.  It is, however, getting much better (tasks, comet on the coming features list).  Still, if you are building a real-time system that needs constant background processing, I'd think twice right now.<p>- if GAE goes down, you're down until they fix things, and will be totally helpless.<p>- some of the GAE goodness/crack means you're locked in (e.g., index building -- to move away you'll have to build equivalent facilities for whatever DB you move to).  Although you can protect yourself by being smart in how you abstract away the GAE.<p>(8) Can't think of anything else.<p>If there is interest, I have been thinking about writing some blog posts about my experience setting up a Clojure+GAE development environment, working with the data store, working the the GAE API, etc.  Let me know here and I'll get a first post out of the way by week's end.",1270358211

It wasn't perfect, but it was the best combination of everything that worked right at the time... The frequent blue screens, freezes, and constant virus & trojan cleaning was getting old, but Windows was still doable overall. Then something MS did, totally pissed me off enough to start trying desktop alternatives: MS started to ensure that Windows could only be installed a certain number of times for a particular machine that had a specific set of components. So if you changed enough of your components for the same licensed machine, Windows might think it was a different computer which was a big no no. Given that you had to have a clean install of Windows every x number of months, I just got fed up. It was the tipping point. I then started going through various distros of Linux and eventually happily landing on OSX.<p>For me, like the blue screens and the viruses, I see this as a possible beginning of enough frustration building to make me move on again. Hopefully this year's WDC (or next) will prove me wrong.",1270358046
