233756,comment,233416.0,233669.0,0,0,dmv,,,"I disagree that it is arbitrary, and with your summary.  There is a very real difference between what is labeled ""programmer"" and ""developer"".  I have been working with a very bright intern lately.  He is a very technically proficient programmer... but he lacks the big picture view.  Every task is approached and estimated by the time it would take to solve a comparable coursework assignment; but the real world is messy.  Figuring out the big picture of his project -- the system -- took far more time than any of the interesting technical challenges.  Only in hindsight does he understand why certain ""obvious"" high-level design decisions were as emphasized early on.<p>I liked the thesis that development gets harder as programming gets easier, but I think it misses the mark as it strays toward 'because kids these days don't know about coding to the metal'.  I think the problem, as has been lamented here in the past, is the speed of prototyping versus implementing.  I have had to sit through a few too many discussions across from a former developer, or development manager, and having to explain that while he was able to construct a mock-up that looks like what we want, in minutes!, we have not even gotten started on a real solution.  Within hours, almost anyone here could simulate the basic Twitter functionality... but scaling it to half their size?",1214966867
