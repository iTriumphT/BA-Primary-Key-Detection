It&#x27;s quorum based as opposed to blockchain based, which allows it to scale such that each node only needs to track log(n) transaction while maintaining a secure network and being able to be certain about the validity of incoming transactions. Storage is cheaper, faster, and more secure than centralized alternatives.

Hamlet is a bigger win - and, in particular, the ability to package up all three into a single widget to be embedded in arbitrary Hamlet, is great.  And all the type safety is a nice bonus.  One thing it does need is more exhaustive documentation - I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anywhere that actually specifies the &quot;embed tag attributes from this list&quot; or &quot;generate a URL with parameters&quot; sigils, save the source and mailing list.

There are at least three ways to use the service:<p>1) The way you described: call a local number, then dial your desired phone number.  It uses caller ID for authentication.  Not perfect, as it can be spoofed, but likely not an issue.<p>2) You go online and enter the phone numbers of several people you call often.  For each, the system allocates you a local phone number.  So, e.g. when I call a specific local (Beijing) number, my mum&#x27;s phone (in London) will ring.  No PINs or double-dialing.<p>3) Like (2) BUT using their app and a data connection (even a slow one) you just dial the number (or choose from your address book) and their app does everything for you.<p>2 & 3 work because you already registered your mobile number with them.  When you dial one of their local access numbers, they can combine those two pieces of information to look up where the call should go.<p>The call quality is great.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive than didlogic.com, but cheaper than Skype.",1404021287

7960471,comment,7958194.0,7958854.0,2,0,lgeek,,,"> I like that all processes run in CPU ring 0 and safety is ensured by the VM. It seems like this is more flexible<p>This approach has a few issues which make it impractical for use by a real general purpose OS:<p>* it moves all work related to safety either to the dynamic compiler (not so bad), when it can statically prove that the code is safe or onto the critical path if it cannot statically prove it safe (which generally causes significant slow-downs). For example a traditional OS will use VM to isolate application memory (where the performance impact comes from the occasional TLB miss), while this sort of approach might require boundary checks to be compiled before many memory instructions<p>* the problems mentioned above could be mostly avoided by requiring use of a language or bytecode format designed to allow the compiler to use static checks, but then all your applications have to use it (which is what Runtime.JS does)<p>* it potentially allows more complex interactions between the OS/VM and the application compared to traditional system calls, which is the sort of things that often enough creates hard-to-predict side effects<p>> allows for more easily provable safety guarantees.<p>I don&#x27;t know about that, hardware is normally formally verified, while software normally isn&#x27;t.

Everything is encrypted all the time through an HSM which will perform decryption only if given the device PIN. The key is never in memory and any attempt to extract it from the HSM will result in its self-destruction. It is impossible to recover data from the phone without the PIN. You can only erase the device and restore from a backup. While the device can be lost, the only threat is that a thief will erase and resell it. With iOS 7 and Find My iPhone turned on, even that is not possible. An attacker would not get your data in any case.<p>This is orders of magnitude safer than a full-disk-encrypted laptop because people hardly ever shut down their laptops, so keys remain in memory. There is also the possibility of cold-boot attacks, and of course the (retrospectively) <i>insane</i> design wherein any program you run can access <i>all</i> of your data.<p>iOS applications are always code-signed in a way that is tied to a real person or corporation, thoroughly sandboxed, and subject to review, making malware essentially non-existent.

This is really incredible, because without even knowing it, huge swaths of the population are using properly end-to-end encrypted messaging just by owning iPhones.<p>iOS is a tight ship and its attack surface is minuscule compared to that of a commodity computer.",1404020137

I really do want to understand it though.<p>Your hypothetical language - is it functional? Because if it is, I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s different from C. If it&#x27;s not, can you show me the equivalent code in a functional language?<p>This is how I understand your code example:<p>def foo (y, x):\n      let z = get(x)\n      assign(x, y*y+z)<p>Jump to address &#x27;foo&#x27;, passing a value stored in register y, and an address stored in register x. \nLoad value at address(x) to register z, then manipulate values of y and z, and store the result at address(x).\nSo far so good.<p>let box = newBox(1)\n    let inp = 3\n    foo(box, inp)\n    let newVal = get(box)\n    print(newVal)<p>Allocate memory for an int, put 1 in there, and store a pointer at register &#x27;box&#x27;. Next, put 3 into register &#x27;inp&#x27;, and jump to &#x27;foo&#x27;, passing values at &#x27;box&#x27; and &#x27;inp&#x27; as x and y (registers don&#x27;t change). &#x27;Foo&#x27; updates the value at the address which we refer to as &#x27;box&#x27; or &#x27;x&#x27;, and we load this value to register &#x27;newVal&#x27;, and print it.<p>The way I see it, if you are using a concept of a &#x27;slot&#x27; or a &#x27;box&#x27; in your code, you have to use some name (label) to refer to the address of this slot. This label would be the name of a pointer in C, or the name of a variable in Python. \nIf you are using a variable which stores a value directly, the name of such variable points to a register.<p>How can you separate a name from what it points to? What would it mean, and most importantly, why would you want to do that?",1404019734

This was a big deal. We made huge progress right there.<p>We have internet now, we are obligated to use this to improve our democratic system.<p>It looks like it today (at least to me) but the reason we have representatives was not because we are to stupid to mow our own lawn.

So if X carries a 5 year sentence if you are convicted of X in isolation, and Y carries a 5 year sentence if you are convicted of Y in isolation, and they are in the same group, then if you are convicted of both X and Y together as the result of one set of facts, you get 5 years.<p>The press release for an indictment charging you with both X and Y will say 10 years.
