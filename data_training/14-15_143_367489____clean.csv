1064850,comment,1062978.0,1063945.0,0,0,Retric,,,"It's not a question of risk, but what you risk and what you gained from the risk.   My point is when you earn above market rates it's often because of risk to capital not effort.  If what's making money is Work you pay SS if it's Capital you don't.  If it's a combination of both you first need to pay SS / Medicare on a reasonable wage for what you are doing, but the extra earnings from Capital * Risk don't require SS / Medicare payments.<p>Under the current system, building an iPhone App is really two things taking a risk with some capital and building the App.  If you work for a year and it makes 120k then you pay taxes as if you worked a normal job.  If you make zero you pay taxes as if it was a hobby.*  If you make 10 million, you pay taxes as if you had a normal job that made ~140k AND made 9,840k from an investment.<p>This is reasonable because when you earn a normal salary from your work your risk had zero return so you pay zero taxes on the risk.  If anything it's when you earn less than market rates when it gets tricky.<p>*(I don't know what the actual tax ramifications of this are.  If you do major home remodeling while unemployed you are not supposed to be able to collect unemployment even though you don't have a direct cash reward. In theory you might be required to pay taxes on the work you did.)",1263999459
1064849,comment,1064622.0,1064725.0,0,0,masak,,,"If I may try to briefly explain/defend the naming as well as expand on the need for it...<p>In Perl 5, 'reverse' did all of the three things: it reversed strings (in scalar context), or lists/hashes (in list context). The latter two weren't really distinguished, since a hash in Perl 5 is just an (even-element) list that you assign to a hash variable.<p>In Perl 6, 'wantarray' <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/wantarray.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/wantarray.html</a> is gone, and not even built-in methods rely on figuring out the void/scalar/list context of the caller. Which means that we don't do the trick described in the blog post to make 'reverse' do either string or list reversal.<p>Very well, no problem. What we lack in 'wantarray' we make up with a type system. We just stick the string-reversing 'reverse' method on the type Str, and the list-reversing one on the type List. All good and well. (In fact, we put the string-reversing one on Any, and let it coerce to Str when needed.)<p>But wait. There are some corner cases where this causes problems. Sometimes a scalar variable contains a list of things, and sometimes a list contains but one element. In either case, we try to magically guess between the two uses, and get it wrong. So maybe making those two behaviours homonyms wasn't too good an idea after all.<p>Hence the need for distinguishing 'flip' and 'reverse'. By distinguishing 'invert', we can make it a bit smarter in case of hash key collisions. The 'magical guessing' dilemma goes away, because it's clear you mean a list when you say 'reverse' and a string when you say 'flip'.<p>The names are fairly well-chosen, considering what they do. You flip a single thing (string), reverse the order of a sequence of elements (list), and invert a mathematical mapping (hash).",1263999444

Those are contractors, hourly, and professional.  If you are not working by the project and don't have to track your time on a clock, then you are a professional employee.  By default any work done by a professional employee which relates to that employee's job function belongs to the employer.  (If a programmer writes a novel, the novel is probably his.  But a program written is probably not his.)  It is standard and customary for employers to add clauses to contracts reiterating that principle.  This makes their case even stronger.<p>And yes, I've been personally caught on the wrong side of this.  And yes, I personally know other people in an unrelated incident whose startup folded in exactly this manner.<p>OTOH if your contract has clauses protecting you then you are likely protected from this.  However the common default is otherwise.<p>By contrast in California state law work done on your own time with your own equipment which does not use your employer's intellectual property is never a work for hire.  This right cannot be signed away.  The result is that your startup on the side is always legally protected.<p>And yes.

Like the author said, once you start thinking about it, it's hard to think about anything else.<p>Not all poor countries are poor in the same way. Although there are clear correlations between crime and poverty -- and corruption -- there are also countries like Thailand, which are poor but with relatively little crime or corruption.<p>So, let's say culture is one factor. If you reduce the education of the people down to what can be passed by word of mouth from one generation to the next, then if that culture's ""story"" is largely one of war or self-interest, then it's more likely to be reinforced by the next generation. On the other hand, if a culture's history includes a somewhat recent spell of relative peace -- even under a dictatorship -- then it's more likely that the next generation will work towards establishing stability.<p>Resources is certainly another factor. It is simply impossible for a country to make roads, high technology, and infrastructure materialize from nothing. It must have natural resources available, either to directly build infrastructure or to trade with other countries for raw materials.<p>Education is another factor -- or, maybe more specifically, the <i>value</i> of education. This is one of the things that concerns me about anti-intellectualism in the U.S.; when education becomes devalued, citizens lose the perspective of history, the opportunity to learn from other countries' mistakes, and the notions of what might be possible in the future.<p>Poverty and corruption are self-reinforcing, too. You can see this even in the poorer communities in ""wealthy"" countries: homes that are in disrepair, common spaces that are mismanaged and poorly kept. I'm sometimes tempted to wonder why people in those communities don't spend a few dollars on paint, or a few hours here and there working on a few repairs, and bring their community out of poverty. Then, I remember how I felt when I was poor: exhausted. There is a tremendous spiritual toll taken by abject poverty; it defeats you the moment you wake up. Your day will likely be a struggle, and if it isn't, then it becomes a rare and valuable rest day. It's a difficult catch-22 to understand if you haven't been in such a situation, but if you're constantly struggling to survive, the last thing you want to do is spend effort to improve your situation.<p>Cameroon at this point isn't likely to change soon, because its poverty and corruption has become cultural. Changing its situation will probably require first a massive sea-change in the government; the death of the current ruler and replacement by someone less politically savvy, or less self-interested. Or, direct intervention by other governments.<p>Then, it will take time. Someone will have to find the energy to build infrastructure while the rest of the citizens learn what it can be like not to struggle every day.",1263997130
