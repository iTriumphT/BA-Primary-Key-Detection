Send photoshop mockups for slicing - get back HTML/CSS/JS\n4. Convert static HTML files to static templates. In our case, it was Django templates. At this stage, we used dummy data so now the site would be served through django, exactly match the Photoshop images and the sliced HTML, data populated through views. That is, the static data is now hardcoded in the code rather than in the HTML.\n5. Incrementally replace each view to serve data from DB instead of hardcoded. Data can be added to DB in Django using an interactive shell or using the admin interface. At this stage, we had our models flushed out and relationships between objects cleared up.\n6. Add additional functionality such as forms and whatnot to actually accept input through the app.\n7. Ajaxify everything to turn the website into a web app.<p>We didn't use any fancy tools beyond what's mentioned above.",1326689700

And calling the financial system ""con artistry vs everyone else on the planet"" is a worthless thing to say because <i>trading, investing, credit, and risk management add value</i> and to say otherwise puts you in a very flimsy position, a position by which you'd have to adopt a wildly heterodox economic view--such as classical Marxism--to reasonably defend yourself.",1326689206

I guess I could write stuff from scratch, and I've found some tools that help you make mockups, but what are the best ones?<p>2. How exactly do you add the functionality with the design? For example, let's say I want to make a  web app using Ruby on Rails, and I make the design for it. I can then create a rails project and build the functionality, but how can I tie the actual functionality with the front-end?

3469386,comment,3469159.0,3469159.0,2,0,Natsu,,,"I can make direct comparisons to the everyday reality seen in one American factory.  Sure, I'm the sysadmin, but I'm responsible for all the computers on the shop floor, among other things.  There's not a soul out there I don't know, and I've seen what things are like when they work until 7 AM the next day to finish things.<p>Here's how these conditions measure up:<p>* 12 hr shifts normal, 14-16 hour shifts common?  Ouch.  They must be at capacity.  Sure, the guys have seen 70+ hour weeks of heavy labor and 20 hour days, but they're not that common, and they usually get their full weekend.  Sure, it's normal that workers stand, but that's what makes working a shift that long so brutal (as well as heavy lifting & heat/cold).  And I'm sure they don't have ergonomic mats to stand on in China.<p>* Inspections known in advance?  That would be normal.  You should expect them to spend roughly the week before the inspection trying to look good.<p>* Management clueless about what's really going on?  Normal.<p>* Unions are illegal in China?  Wow.  I thought they were, you know, Communists or something.  This being a ""Right to Work"" state, I've never dealt with unions either.<p>* Kids working under-age?  Don't see that here.  Your average US shop floor factory worker is an HS-dropout or ex-con (or both).  Nobody works there because they want to and the burn-out rate is usually pretty high.  In a good economy, it would be ~15% turnover per month, though that goes down almost to zero when jobs are scarce.  I'm sure they need the money, but I sure wouldn't want to see kids needing to do that sort of thing.  US workers make roughly 10-15x as much, depending on experience, though I don't know how the buying power compares.<p>* Worker dorms?  We've only ever joked about sleeping in the parking lot after really long days.  I thought those went out of style here centuries ago.<p>* Workers burn out really fast here, too.  But we have Workman's Comp for those who get injured and MSDS sheets & safety gear for anyone handling dangerous chemicals.  The Chinese are getting completely screwed here if they're getting injured and tossed aside.<p>* ""One man got his hand crushed in a metal press at Foxconn. Foxconn did not give him medical attention.""  That sort of thing does happen here, except that you get medical attention.  Oddly enough, <i>I</i> gave someone medical attention for almost the same injury not too long ago.  His hand just needed a few stitches.  He did return to work on light duty the next day, though.<p>* Here, they just send you home if you're getting too much OT and they complain about how long things take, even if their estimates were totally unreasonable.  I've never seen anyone get blacklisted or anything like that.<p>In short, we have it a lot better here, but there are quite a few things that need improvement.  The Chinese are really getting screwed on the safety side of things.  I don't know if factories are ever truly safe, but you can do a lot better than that.",1326688495

The sane place to ""get off"" is somewhere in the middle of the Comfort tier.<p>Leisure is freedom-to (travel, be educated), Comfort is freedom-from (housework, annoyances), and Status is mostly about the ability to maintain maxed-out Comfort (about $2-3M per year, post-tax) without doing anything of value, i.e. being able to get all that just for being ""special"" (the narcissist's dream). Power is the ability to dick up and down peoples' Status on a whim, because a lot of people who've maxed out the other tiers get bored and need something to do.<p>Of course, these tiers are fuzzy. Most of us would find business-class travel to be enough Comfort, but some people require a private jet.

I found that a simple spreadsheet worked best in the end, but I had to review it a few times to make sure I didn't mess up the numbers.<p>In our case, the investor said: we value your company at X, we're willing to invest Y, and we need ESOP of Z%. From that, I had to reverse engineer the percentage and number of stocks that all involved would get.<p>The method that worked for me was to convert everything to number of shares and price per share before and after investing, and then calculate percentages based on shares / total shares for each party. This way, it's easy to calculate how many shares the investor gets based on the valuation (which determines pre-money share value), and final percentages based on total number shares after all is said and done.<p>A few things make a generic spreadsheet hard to create, and you should keep in mind:\n- Is the investor paying based on % or share value?\n- Are the ESOP stocks issues before or after the investment? (you get ripped off if it's before)\n- Are you issuing new stocks or giving up a percentage of existing ones?<p>I hope this helps.",1326688113

This attitude often seems motivated by isolated incidents--the tendency of any deep pocketed company to attract bad press and lawsuits--not the general effect of large business on people as accounted for by sound economic data. In general, large businesses tend to offer better jobs and more advanced economies tend to have more, larger businesses.

By the time I'm done with the book I'll have taken apart the entire book and shown that it's the source of most security holes through poor examples.<p>> However, it fails to point out that some of the exercises are just that; exercises.

If you feel that people should evaluate all things objectively (I agree!) then do it yourself and actually read K&R again.<p>And by the way, they updated it several times to remove defects since you probably read it.  My copy was only a few years old and I had to update it because they fixed bugs in that copy() function I tear apart (but not enough).<p>> If you're programming C, read K&R. If you're doing it professionally, you probably also want to read Deep Sea Programming by Peter van der Linden.<p>I agree, solid recommendations, but I'm going to advocate people read K&R for historical reasons and to practice code review, which is what I'm doing in my book.",1326687113

The article says this will work at 150 atoms, which sounds about right, but isn't really substantiated by the actual experiment.<p>I'd also note that while this is a very cool experiment, the fact that it was performed using a scanning tunneling microscope means it's not exactly a practical device :)  But as a proof of principle of storing a bit in a few number of atoms, this is a very neat result.",1326686575

Even if you choose the entrepreneurial route, it is not the engineering that pays the bills, it is the interacting with other people. If you want your business to be successful, you will have to eventually delegate out the engineering so that you can focus on building the business.<p>With that, if you are only driven by financial gains (as opposed to the love of doing), why would anyone bother with the science/engineering step when you can put all of your focus on people-oriented jobs from the start?",1326686525

Instead, a simple web service with a twist: Zappos has a private key and LastPass has the corresponding public key. Now, if Zappos.com is compromised and the breached is discovered and fixed, their CEO/CTO/head security guy grabs the private key and authenticates to LastPass, telling them that he is in fact who he says he is, and finally triggers the massive automatic password reset. Obviously, this will not work if the private key is compromised, but then again, our whole web security paradigm is ""trust that the website owner knows what s/he is doing"", so this is already a step up.<p>Or, as I mentioned, let's do away with passwords. Anyone can have your public key so long as your private key stays private.",1326686480
