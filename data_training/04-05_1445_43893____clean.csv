It gives the poor a way to earn a living, an activity to count on, some sense of being independent (instead of relying on welfare), and it enables them to save (even a little) money. It makes them responsible. It provides them experience that they can build on to become better at what they do and aspire for something a little more advanced. Most poor people who work do not stay at the bottom of their society for their whole life.

But you're either a perfectionist, or have no contact or experience with anyone living in poverty. Keeping people who are impoverished out of trouble and giving them a job no matter how demeaning is the most important first step. Believe me, I live in St. Louis, We're tied with Detroit for having the most violent crime in the whole United States. Poor people living the ghetto are not all the ""poor souls being taken advantage of"" that you think they are. Those people need discipline, a job, and ANY kind of income. No one will hire them for a reason. They're not just well behaved people sitting around hoping for a miracle. They have serious behavioral problems that really hurt their ability to have ANY kind of job. And a mechanical Turk solution is the last hope for many of them.<p>Also, in your attempt to achieve ""perfect"" you will end up achieving nothing.<p>I understand your thought process and it DOES make sense but we are not living in a perfect world, we are living in capitalism. And if you don't pay poor people in America a few pennies to type in ""cat"" next to a picture of a cat, that business owner will go to another country and get them to type ""cat"" next to a picture of a cat.<p>In the perfect world this wouldn't be an issue, there would be a world wide minimum wage but there isn't.

You have to take it from someone else. Just look at the Palistinian/Israeli conflict. Ownership over one little strip of land has caused so much bloodshed and destroyed so many lives.

So, the spec for std::stable_sort was aimed at Mergesort: O(n log n) comparisons and O(n) additional space due to the space required by the Stable Merge. <i>HOWEVER</i>, if limited space is available, then it is allowed to use O(n log n log n) comparisons, since a slower in-place algorithm is used.

But it certainly sounds like it would be a better fall-back option.<p>Similarly, lots of languages have moved toward some version of Mergesort for their standard sorting algorithm: Perl, Python (""Timsort"" is a Mergesort variant).

I'd also like to add he was a great guy and incredibly knowledgeable. I think he knew he was sick because he gave me 6 or 7 Java books for free out of his personal bookshelf.,1330315305
