It's more commonly some sort of good-cop bad-cop routine, where the line manager really appreciates your work and fights hard for you against the upper level manager, who is just so stingy about raises in general.  If you're stellar, you wind up with something way better than your teammates, but an insult compared to what you could command on an open market.<p>I think on some level, they're constrained by collective bargaining agreements.  Maybe they hope you've been with the company so long you only see the people around you.  Maybe <i>they</i> only see the people around <i>them</i>.<p>There was a real technical superstar of a guy a few years ago.  I didn't work with him, but a coworker did.  He went to management and said, ""Give me a 17% raise or I'm leaving.""  They didn't and he did.  The fallout was cataclysmic.<p>I left a project about three years ago, and there was widespread panic when I announced my decision to leave.  I took four months to pack things up and leave them in a stable state, but you cannot totally mask the absence of talent.  A coworker asked, ""Is there anything this program could do to make you stay?""  I answered, ""No.""  He said, ""How about a 200% raise?"" I said, ""Oh, I'd stay another year for that.""  Judging from the fallout over that year, it would have been an efficient option.  But they either didn't have the power or didn't have the perception.",1289368765

1889353,comment,1887442.0,1889264.0,0,0,derefr,,,"I didn't mean to imply that they were the <i>same</i>—just that, in practice, where a systems programmer thinks ""use an in-memory binary tree data structure"", an application programmer thinks ""use a database"", and a B-tree is what they end up using under the layers of abstraction and encapsulation. Yes, a binary tree and a B-tree are bad substitutes for one another, but you'll be much, much better off substituting a B-tree for a binary tree, or vice-versa, than substituting in, say, a linked list.<p>A cooking analogy: you wouldn't drink cream instead of milk—but if a recipe calls for milk and you don't have any, cream is a much better call than orange soda.<p>For some things (implementing a virtual filesystem, say), the app programmer will make the call to use a database, and they'll be fine, because a B-tree is just what a virtual filesystem needs. For others—storing and evaluating a Lisp AST, for example—they'll have to make O(N) roundtrips through the database and create a bunch of useless indexing cruft, but if the AST is complex <i>enough</i>, and if they're beta-reducing and caching their results in each parent node as they go, then this is still likely to outperform an alternative implementation that naively uses any of the other three data structures.",1289368334

That's why it's called a ""traffic funnel,"" since the process takes a broad array of search topics and eventually pushes all of them back to a central site.<p>Imagine that you're in this to create more than the traffic funnel. You would want to integrate the content for popular searches into a site with additional depth and subsidiary business - e.g. if you sell carpentry products, you might also put up articles about basic home repairs.<p>If you go 100% of the way, build a brand image around the content, and then sell a product at the end of the line, the funneling process should give you lots of new business. You've established an ""instant relationship"" with customers through your content, which will put you ahead of most competitors.<p>People trying to scale this horizontally, like your employer, are only doing the first step in the process and working out deals to secure the others. But I don't think it's a good long-term business. The low-quality content you're pumping out will gradually get eaten away by stronger niche competitors.",1289366195
