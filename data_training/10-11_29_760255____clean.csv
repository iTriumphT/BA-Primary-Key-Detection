Goldman Sachs takes huge risks, gets compensated, fails, gets bailed out by the working class citizens, goes on to pay an average salary of $700,000[1].  Is that what these people are worth?  Yes, if the market says so?  Do the tax-payers have a say?  They should, if they're the ones ""insuring"" them.<p>New methods and technology in fishing have meant that we've been (nearly quite literally) sweeping the ocean.  No one disputes that we're down below 10% of large fish stocks.  The question is, if we stop now, will the fish be able to get back up again to self-sustaining levels?  It's unkown.  But we haven't stopped fishing/sweeping.  Why?  Because it's not a 100%, and as long as that's the case, the fishing industry is loathe to lose its income on a mere 'speculation'.<p>The free market is sometimes a bright child, and other times a petulant, special-needs brat.  It is often shortsighted and cliquish.  John Nash discovered this and corrected it, but we still are operating in the old mode of Smith thinking.  You say that a CEO is worth 200-times an average worker because the markets say so, but that's not a Nash equilibrium.  You can have it for a while but it won't hold for that very reason.  Extreme wealth distribution in either direction (very equal or very unequal) is not a Nash equilibrium and, until it become one, the center won't hold.<p>It's you, Paul, not these children/students you chide in your essay, who's operating under a poor model.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32809328/ns/business-the_new_york_times"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32809328/ns/business-the_new_yor...</a>",1252839412

What things I enjoy doing, what things I really can’t stand. How those things affect how I perform my job. What I can do to make the things I can’t stand to be less painful and what to do to make things I enjoy more enjoyable. Basically I am just trying to improve what I do 8 hours per day, 5 days a week.",1252837454
