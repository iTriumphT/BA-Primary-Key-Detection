113127,comment,113060.0,113060.0,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Social ads are only cool if they can get you to start a conversation about the product with your friends. That's why the movie trailers they show in theaters are so effective. Because if they're cool you can talk about them to your friends sitting on either side of you. And then go see the movie a couple months later when it comes out.<p>Facebook social ads are lame because they don't start conversations. People complain about YouTube's plan to show preroll commercials, but honestly I don't think it's such a bad idea. Except instead of showing ads in front of all videos, only show ads in front of the movies that you've favorited. Why? Because when you watch a movie that's in your favorites, it's usually because you're showing your friends. So then there exists the potential to start a conversation. And the other 90% of the time when you're watching YouTube alone the ads never bother you.",1202687749
113126,comment,112899.0,112899.0,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"His logic is that because your college isn't the best for you at each individual class, it isn't the best for you overall. That's stupid. One must be. If there are 2,000 colleges and you chose one at random, you'd have a 1/2,000 chance of having chosen the best. Not (1/1000)^35 or whatever that moron came up with.<p>Not to mention it's most likely that the top x are all so close to the best for an individual, if such a thing could truly be quantified, that the difference between them is negligible. Let's say that the top 5% are that way, you now have a 5% chance, given random selection. Add in the fact that people don't attend random colleges, and there's a pretty non-zero chance that you're attending the college you should. Most people probably fail, but even then not be enough that it would have been worth the massive effort required.<p>I'm guessing from his abominable logic that this guy went to the wrong college.",1202687538

113124,comment,113060.0,113060.0,0,0,TheTarquin,,,I use facebook a fair bit and I've gotten so used to using it that I'd forgotten it had ads.  I read this article and then had to check facebook to see if it actually display ads.  I've been just totally screening them out.,1202687135

I wouldn't mind sharing my overall idea with a few people just to see what details they have in mind. If it's good, I'd ask them to be my partner. And if they take the idea and develop it into something better then me, then so be it. they deserve it more.",1202685642

I mean, you could click to another channel, but then you ran the risk of missing part of the program that you were originally watching.<p>Nowadays, of course, I can easily go for years without seeing a TV commercial, so I guess you're right: an ad on Facebook, however ineffective, is better than an ad I never see. But TiVO users are still a minority in the world, so TV and radio ads are still plenty effective.",1202684764
