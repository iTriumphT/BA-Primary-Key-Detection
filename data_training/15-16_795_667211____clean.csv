I showed him my rental contract. I showed him a mobile phone bill, bank statement proof, etc but none of those were acceptable to him.<p>So I go downstairs and find a driving instructor and pay his fees. This time he files a separate application just 30 mins after my application gets rejected and this time the guy doesn't even bother reading anything in the application. He just signs it and it's all taken care of. Basically the driving school guy pays the DMV officers a commission for every application that they approve.",1270396782

Both have strengths, and once most phones are carrier upgraded to 2.0/2.1 (as they're supposed to be before 7/1/2010), some of the biggest weaknesses will go away. The amusing thing is that <i>none of the fundamentals</i> are better on android beyond the multitasking, and it's apple's willful overcontrol of their ecosystem which grants 80% of android's wins.<p>The developer tools suck for android compared to the Apple ones (I've spoken about this at length in past comments), especially their lack of GUI layout tool.<p>Android is a <i>great</i> product though. <i></i>If the iPhone wasn't here, people would be buying it in droves still (and people <i>are</i> buying it in droves, which wouldn't be the case if apple went for a more carrier agnostic approach)<i></i>. There is no quality control so everything looks different, for sure. Google's apps are meh for the most part. However that little bit of openness makes it so people <i>can do what they want</i> on the phone, and it has an API for most everything. Here are things android can do that the iPhone can't:<p>Reactive intents to handle events on the phone via custom third party apps.<p>These intents means the phone's ringer can be turned off for certain numbers at 6pm, other calls can always be ignored, other calls can result in loud warning rings. Apple has no way at all to even <i>change</i> half the sounds, never mind ringer profiles for different times of days like cell phones have had since 1999 even in the default interface, never mind actually writing a 3rd party API for it.<p>Android phone apps can interact with the calendars. Apple's can't.<p>Android phones can use custom ringers. Apple's Can't<p>Android phones can record telephone calls, Apple's decided that's verboten no matter what.<p>Android phones can help manage the small resources on the phone. Apple gets pissy when you even think about looking in areas of the phone beyond your sandbox.<p>Apple phones are forbidden from using third party calling services. Android phones can use whatever they want (this really bugs me, as I use 2 different calling services to help with business issues).<p>Additionally, android supports physical keyboards (did you know women with nails can't really use onscreen keyboard? Their nails don't register on touches so thumb keyboards are very awkward if usable at all for them).<p>Oh yeah: Other strengths: Available on all major carriers at the moment. The current height of agnosticism for the iphone is that you can hack your iPhone to run on t-mobile.<p>The Apple error handling capability, especially when dealing with movie player errors, is practically non-existant. Android has much better disaster recovery abilities<p>Where are the apple strengths?<p>The UI is prettier (but not always more usable) for most apple apps.<p>The on screen keyboard is stronger on the iPhone platform<p>The dev tools are far and a away better<p>The documentation and examples are much better for iPhoneOS<p>The MoviePlayer is much better on iPhoneOS (even though they did a vast, app breaking revamp for 3.2).<p>The fact the apps are compiled C code based of GCC makes the  platform easier to target with 3rd party languages (like Corona or others)<p>The fact there are so many fewer phone installed OS's (and that the user is stuck where their handset manufacturer provides them) means apple has a big win on consistent underlying OS.<p>The constant screen aspect ratios allows cheaper fixed width art.<p>The creation of support technologies (such as Notifications, In-App purchases, and HTTPLiveStreaming) make the apple iPhone do certain things quite a bit easier.<p>So all and all: the iPhone is more polished. But lacking an iPhone for their carrier, many people are very happy with android phones (at least the android part, people are POed about the battery life in the G1). Additionally, many people find the Apple Will Control Your Life not just idealistically chafing, but also <i>in the way of what they're trying to do every day</i>. I'm seriously considering swapping to an android phone for everyday use once they upgrade them all to 2.0/2.1 so I can get reasonable 3G performance (and so I can use multiple dialers). But at the same time, I'm buying an iPad (Which ostensibly I'll need to use for work to debug iPad apps, but I also expect to surf with it on the couch). Apple has repeatedly exercised control <i>in areas which do not help it's technical fundamentals</i> and has lost out to android in those areas. It's almost comical that Android is better than iPhone in some places only because Apple is controlling about certain things.",1270396225

1240304,comment,1239815.0,1239963.0,0,0,elblanco,,,"I've done a bit of work with tries and hash functions and found that in-memory tries are almost universally faster than in-memory hashes, no matter how good the hash function is.<p>The difference though is on average around 20-30% faster if both implementations are well optimized. But they come with lots of downsides that need to managed well, tries explode into memory very quickly requiring all kinds of memory optimizations to the naive tries to keep the tree depth short (usually with a small hash on the leaves). I remember building an in-memory trie library once in Perl that outperformed a native C hash library by 70%. The development team's jaws dropped when my code was running, they were insisting it wasn't actually doing anything at all and I was faking the output. ""There is no way Perl code can outperform our C."" It was an interesting learning experience all around. Suffix trees likewise are insane for full text searching.<p>Hashes on the other hand have a few benefits, they are more compact in memory, on average have fast lookups (though if you try and constrain the hash table growth algorithm too much the can spend a lot of time on both collisions and on table growth operations) and have many many more high quality implementations in most standard libraries, including many very good and very fast on-disk hashes that only consume another few percentage points (single digits usually) off of speed.<p>The problem with tries is not that they are fast, there really isn't anything faster (in memory) that I'm aware of for lookup and retrieval problems. But tries are like sports cars, really fast, but lots of downsides. Hashes are like an upper end practical family car.<p>If you try and put the trie on disk, you end up with all sorts of problems that you don't really see in modern on-disk hash implementations. Coming off of disk, hashes tend to be the better option (in fact many of the on-disk trie interfaces I've seen actually just use hashes for the on-disk portion and optimize for tree depth in memory to keep things small).<p>So it depends, if the set of things you want to use for lookups is relatively small and you can cram it all into memory in a raw trie, it'll be a bit faster. If the set is big, and you want to use it off of disk, go with a hash.<p><i></i> Also, if the values you wish to store don't map well to a trie, like floating point numbers, you pretty much have to go with a hash. Fortunately, the hash function in that case is really easy ;) <i></i>",1270395382

1240275,comment,1237939.0,1237939.0,0,0,vahakota,,,"With similiar goals as the OP this fine-tuned protein shake has become the cornerstone of my food intake:<p>3 dl of non-fat milk (taste & liquid)\n1 dl of ice cream (taste & carbs)\n1 dl of whey protein powder (taste & protein)\n5 ml of dry-pressed sunflower oil (omega-6 fats)\n5 ml of dry-pressed flax oil (omega-3 fats)\n1 cl of ispaghula husk (fiber)\n1 cl of freeze dried fruit powder (antioxidants)<p>The energy intake is divided quite evenly among carbs, protein and fats. It provides 1) the essential fats in a decent ratio, 2) a good dose of varying amino acids, 3) enough fiber for the digestive system to function and 4) a good dose of antioxidants. With a quick preparation now and then it is super fast to produce, takes almost no cleaning afterwards and the taste can be varied with different ice cream flavours. It might take a few drinks to get used to the taste if you have never consumed protein supplements but if you pick the right protein powder, use milk instead of water and get good ice cream, this tastes very good. And for some reason I haven't gotten bored with this even after months of almost daily use (on several meals).<p>For fast consumption buy a big bowl (with a lid as ispaghula reacts with moisture without it) and mix 10-20 portions of protein, ispaghula husk and dried fruits in the correct ratio. Store a dedicated 1 dl cup in the bowl. Prepare a ready mix of flax and sunflower oil in the correct ratio and keep it in the fridge with the milk - you can learn to pour about 10ml of it by hand fast. Cut a whole pack of ice cream in small (about 2cl) bits in advance and store it in the original pack in the freezer. For mixing I use a protein shaker which can be flushed with water after use.<p>I get my protein powder, fruit powder and the shaker from <a href=""http://myprotein.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myprotein.co.uk/</a> in bulk, which makes this one of the cheapest healthy snacks (below 1$ per serving of about 400kcal). My preferred protein taste is Chocolate Smooth. Ispaghula seeds I get in the form of Pfizers laxative medicine (which is nothing but ispaghula husks and a bit of added sweetener) which goes by the name of Vi-Siblin in the nordics. You might find it with the brand Isogel. I prefer Vi-Siblin S which is sweetened with sorbitol instead of sugar.<p>Don't let the ""unnatural protein shake"" scare get you. This is a balanced and healthy choice proven by active athletes around the world and it provides your essential macronutritients in easy form. You should still make sure you get enough micronutrients elsewhere as the dried fruid powder is in the mix mainly for it's antioxaditive qualities, but also on that front I would not shy away from the vitamin supplements as this drink provides a good essential fat balance which helps the intake of fat soluble micronutrients also in that form.<p>For those who are trying to get leaner, the drink works pretty well also without the ice cream. This shifts the calorie balance heavily on protein and good fats which keeps you fed for long and provides pretty much all you need to sustain muscle mass while losing fat.",1270394714
