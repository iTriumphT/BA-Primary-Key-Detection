Just found it creative, and if anything, good for a little chuckle that originated in the community.<p>That said, I'm a programmer, and have a background in EE and CS--I see myself as a hacker, though I'm always still learning.  And I posted a comment supporting the change from startup news to hacker news, lamenting how I was sick of reading facebook and how to get VC money articles.  So I was a little bit surprised by your comment, and made me reflect on my comment.<p>I think it's very easy to not read your feeds and just rely on hacker news.  But then you end up reading what other people think is interesting, and that's a problem if it's not aligned.  I agree with rms in this thread.  I think if you want it better, you can always submit things you find interesting.  That's what I do, and from my list of submissions, you can see it's usually tech things and programming issues.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=iamwil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=iamwil</a><p>But not everything gets upped that I think is interesting--for example, the Software Radio, and it's something you just shrug your shoulders at.<p>Of course, in hindsight, one can argue that little slips like this makes it a slippery slope, and pretty soon, we'll get pictures of lolcats fixing computers.  That's not an unreasonable argument, considering we have lessons about boiling frogs, and never hire B people that hire C people.<p>Hacker news is as much my home as it is yours, so all apologies.  I'd like to have it tickle my interesting bone everyday.  Only serious interesting stuff from now on.  >:-|\n",1190993315

He has a whole book about Aristophane's take on Socrates, highlighting the crucial tension between the philosopher and the rest of society - the reason Socrates was killed.

So, to rephrase my question more exactly: what are the deep underlying problems of the web that need the type of strong theory I can learn at university?<p>In answer to your last set of questions, something that really needs to be made is an aggregation service for all the web 2.0 stuff out there.  People want an integrated, secure, and trust based work/socializing platform, and my current research interests are geared towards solving this kind of problem.
