Some points to clarify:<p>* The ""finance minister who knew nothing about economics"" was actually a very respected sociologist, a senator and a very intelligent and skilled politician. He later became known as president Fernando Henrique Cardoso. I.M.O. one of the best 3 presidents this country had.<p>* What Edmar Bacha, Pedro Malan and others did was to break inflation's inertia/momentum. A lot of people already knew it was necessary; but no one else knew how to do it.<p>* The article doesn't comment on the strict and cautious monetary policy implemented by Fernando Cardoso. It was as much important as the ""fake money"" trick.<p>* Big inflation was a huge tax on the poorest people. Because they were poor, they didn't have the knowledge and means to protect against rising prices. It is because inflation ended that they began consuming more and the country increased their internal markets.<p>[Edit]Wikipedia has a more comprehensive explanation about what we call here Plano Real : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plano_real"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plano_real</a>  [/Edit]",1286240261

1758186,story,,,1,0,joneath,Show HN: Portrit - Your Facebook As Photos,,"Check out my blog post on the features and functionality of Portrit: http://blog.portrit.com/what-is-portrit<p>Today I am pre-announcing Portrit. Portrit is your Facebook as photos. Take Facebook, distill it to the simplest parts and put the focus on photos and you got Portrit.<p>I started making Portrit four months ago when I realized that Facebook's photo service really sucks. Photos on Facebook are tucked away behind many clicks from the home page. Once you do get to them you are greeted by a photo viewer that is dated to say the least. I knew there was a better way of viewing photos so that's when I started on Portrit.<p>Portrit is a persistent state web app that uses a single page. Around 95% of the code base runs as client side JavaScript. I am using LocalStorage and SessionStorage to cache all Facebook queries to make it fly.<p>I will be opening up a public beta in the next few days and of course HN will be the first place to get Beta keys.<p>Here is the landing page where you can signup for the beta: http://portrit.com",1286240214

Everyone would be charged hefty fees to keep their money in the bank, and no interest at all on their deposits (not that there's much to speak of nowadays anyway). Nobody would go for that.<p>Good comment and I'm upvoting you, but you're actually describing classical banking. Under classical banking, there's two different kinds of banks - ""deposit banks"" that you pay fees to hold your money for you which you can get whenever, and ""loan banks"" where you can only collect your money at certain times that pay interest (it works similarly to a bond).<p>We're in a system that's mixed - a ""savings and loan banking"" system. The problem is that your money is both loaned out, <i>and</i> you can collect it at any time. When too many people do this, it's a bank run, and the bank goes bankrupt leading to lots of problems and turmoil.<p>To make this system work, you need a central reserve bank and fiat currency that can be printed. Unfortunately, this inevitably gets abused by some unfrugal government sooner or later, leading to the country's financial system going through hell and back. Historically, every fiat currency has eventually gone down to zero value.<p>I think classical banking could work in the modern era - separating out into savings banks and loan banks. Interest rates would go up, and there'd be less speculative buying. It'd smooth the boom/bust cycle, at the expense of some growth during booms. I think it could work, but yeah, it'd be very different than things are now.",1286240187

A run on the bank due to panic WILL bankrupt the bank - nobody pretends otherwise... the fact of the matter is most people won't do that, and won't take their money out of the bank, and the system as designed allows the banks to take on some risk in order to make the money flow and keep things moving.<p>And there are banks out there in the world that have huge reserve requirements (50% +), and even some that don't lend out your money, and don't pay interest - they also charge you a reasonably hefty fee for keeping your money safe.<p>Imagine the fallout if banks suddenly had 100% reserve requirements.

Sentiment analysis - green for positive stories; red for negative stories; yellow for neutral stories; blue \nfor sponsors; orange for announcements \n4. Four tabs - recent stories, trending stories, badges and options pages \n5. Recent stories will show all stories in a chronological order \n6. Trending stories will show top 10 most voted stories \n7. 18 badges will give incentives for users to launch/use the app regularly and increase engagement \n8. Options page will have users resubscribe to the app, manage push alerts and a host of other options \n9. Push notifications for instant breaking news alerts \n10. Shake device for positive-only, negative-only, neutral-only and regular story listings \n11. Advertise “TrendOY!” on social sharing services with page branding \n12.
