Basically, this is <i>fear</i> of being exposed.<p>In our (the Western) society, this is most true for sexual and/or violent thoughts, as well as anti-government or anti-religious thoughts. Particularly when it comes to sexual thoughts, I cannot find a reason for holding back any of them.",1240829975

581168,comment,581050.0,581117.0,0,0,miked,,,">> Any moral is a balance between human needs/wants and some theory about how society functions best.<p>It was Nietzsche's great insight that internal considerations play a much larger role in constructing morality than external considerations. See, in particular, _On the Genealogy of Morals_ and _Beyond Good and Evil_. Nietzsche's first questions on encountering a morality were always: what ""instincts"" are active here? Does this ethic arise from a overwelling of strength and confidence, or from resentment, envy, and fear? Nietzsche called the former good and the latter bad. He despised the Political Correctness of his time. I've no doubt he would have attacked the PC beliefs of our era as well, seeing them the same way that pg does: as arising out of fear.",1240828745

581158,comment,581050.0,581050.0,0,0,miked,,,">> If you said them all you'd have no time left for your real work. You'd have to turn into Noam Chomsky.<p>Chomsky could, I suppose, be taken as a heretic. After all, he did write an introduction for a book that denied the Holocaust. He also traveled to Lebanon and had hail-fellow-well-met meetings with the leaders of Hezbollah.<p>He also demands that people divest from Israel -- a nation he has criticized -- while owning several million dollars of real estate in the U.S., a nation he has criticized a lot more -- to worldwide applause. Indeed, in a poll a few years ago -- Europeans rated him the world's most important intellectual. Anti-Americanism and anti-semitism (often, not always, dressed up as anti-Israeli sentiment) are some of the most widely accepted normative beliefs in the world today.<p>All of these would be criticized by many on the American right, but, with the partial exception in developed countries of Holocaust denial, most of the world's people would have no problem with them.<p>You seem to see Chomsky as a heretic. I see him as a prime example of something Eric Hoffer wrote about over a half-centruy ago in _The True Believer_: the formerly creative man who has lost his powers and who compensates by becoming a fanatic. Chomsky's books are international bestsellers. Chomsky's MIT faculty peers made him an Institute Professor. I'm a fan of your writing PG, but I'm sorry, I'm missing the heretical heroism.

However, the majority of students are very down-to-earth and there are <i>many</i> students who are not wealthy that feel perfectly at home there, and don't feel excluded or ""poor."" There are numerous students I know of receiving financial aid, and they blend right in along with everyone else.<p>It's noticeably a ""private"" school, but I wouldn't call it a ""boutique"" school. UMich, of course, is much larger in scale being a public school, whereas WashU is a fraction of the size.<p>Despite the fact that most students at the school are fairly motivated, it is still very possible to stand out through hard work, or by doing something unique with your skills. The engineering school is fantastic (I am an art student myself, but most of my friends are either engineers or med students), but the sports at the school lacks. The teams aren't <i>terrible</i>, but they aren't very good -- if you must have sports, that's where UMich shines.<p>The dorm situation, if you haven't seen it, is very nice. The ""South 40"" is where all the major housing is (especially for Freshman and Sophomores), and they are actually building some brand-new housing for next year (they took out some of the older housing). The community aspect within the South 40 is great, lots of events held by RAs, student groups, etc.<p>As well, in your Junior and Senior years, you can live in ""The Village"", some of the school-owned apartments, or off-campus (there are lots of apartments and houses for rent within walking distance to the school). All are great living arrangements, though cost differs widely between them.<p>Both of the schools, as grandalf <i>concluded</i>, are great and either one makes for a fantastic choice. The major differences are the scale, weather, and ""rah-rah""ness of the school.",1240827374
581148,comment,581050.0,581050.0,0,0,david927,,,"What you're bring up here, Paul, are framesets.  Framesets are the context we place the information we gather.  Every minute we get new information, what we choose to accept and reject (and the angle we view that information) is based on these framesets.  The stronger you are emotionally, the broader your frameset can get.<p>Note that I didn't say, ""The stronger you are intellectually."" It has /nothing/ to do with how smart your are.  I know amazingly smart people with tiny framesets on, for example, patriotism.  Their country is great and everyone wishes they could live there, etc. It's a psychological trait and is worst in the aspects where we are weakest.<p>The stronger (and usually smaller) a frameset is, the more it can't be argued against.  Logic won't work.  And heresy is simply when we poke at strong framesets.<p>The way to battle them is: to be a good person.  By being good (honest to yourself, honest to others, loving, and generous), you push up pool.  When you do the opposite, you pull it down.  The healthier we get and society gets, the less we'll need framesets.  In other words, by making the world a better place we'll make it ... less messed up. :) You know what I mean.",1240827269

I'm reminded of Pasternak denouncing the phrase ""We the people's"" in Dr. Zhivago. It's a word that the community that use it most often are utterly stripping bear and bastardising. As far as I'm concerned there are only two (with a possible third) definitive singularities - those of the ""black holes and baby universes"". <br/><p>I really can't see the useful application of the metaphor here. It's not a singularity... a wave, certainly. This gives us the idea of the ""seventh wave"" which concentrates the potency of the waveform. Or how about a renaissance? It will get to the point where software development, especially in AI, reaches a functional plateau. Branching out and diversifying into many stylistic forms. Or (my personal favourite) a ""Babel Event"", where we construct a universal medium, shattering the old converging paradigms and multiplying our complexities by an order of magnitude.\n<br/>\nSurely these are far more ""useful metaphors"" than the idea of a singularity - the point at which the rules change, or the classical conventions are destroyed?
