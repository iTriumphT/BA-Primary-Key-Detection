153496,comment,153487.0,153487.0,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Start with Django unless you have a very good reason to use one of the other ones.  Very good reasons include<p>1.) Previous skills with Mako, SQLAlchemy, Paste, or any of the other libraries that Pylons or Turbogears is based upon.<p>2.) Previous code in one of the above libraries<p>3.) Functionality needs that Django cannot satisfy in at least a couple of the following areas: authentication, user models, multiple database support, template extensibility, deployment.  I say ""at least a couple"" because if you just need one, you can import it like you would in any other framework.  The price is that many existing Django add-ons won't be aware of your choice.<p>Bad reasons include:<p>1.) ""Django's only for CMSes.""  Not true; it works just as well for anything that involves web apps, including AJAX apps.<p>2.) ""It's not scalable enough.""  The Washington Post runs on Django; I doubt you're going to get more pageviews than them.<p>3.) ""My data doesn't easily fit in the relational paradigm.""  That's what the import statement is for; you can hook any data source you want up to a Django view.<p>4.) ""Django's templating language is too restrictive.""  That's what template tags are for.<p>5.) ""I'm really doing a full-fledged AJAX app, not a website.""  You can output JSON or XML data from a Django view as easily as HTML, and you're not limited to any particular JavaScript library.  (I actually think Django views are more convenient for this than Pylons controllers; there's less boilerplate.)",1207183962

Especially fees since that's essentially ""free money"" for them.  So they really don't like anyone who pays off bills in full each month (transactors aka ""deadbeats"").<p>Also, take a close look at your credit offers and statements.  Cash advances are almost always at a higher interest rate and don't have a grace period like purchases.  Odds are you still would have been accessed the finance charges even under the original lending agreement.",1207183841

Two possibilities which immediately come to mind are (a) these startups are founded by amazing people who have lots of different options, and they only decided at the last minute that doing a startup was something they wanted to do; and (b) these startups were going to happen and be successful with or without YC, and they only realized at the last minute that YC had something useful to offer them.",1207183026
153487,story,,,38,39,aneel99,Ask HN: Choosing a Python framework for web development?,,"Hi all,\nI'm new to programming and started developing software using Python around 6 months back. I also know a bit of C#, C, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Not an expert in any thing, still learning. Also, I'm not very good at Regular Expressions--this was a new-year resolution ;)\nNow I've come across a dilemma and find myself completely stumped. I cannot figure what Python web-framework I should choose to start developing web-based software using Python. I've looked at the websites of Django, Pylon, CherryPy and WebPy--and I couldn't decide ;( Considering my naive skills I intend to choose a lightweight framework and a framework with which I can easily use JavaScript for client-side scripting (my biggest fear). I think I'm in a company of some very smart people here so I will really appreciate if you can help me in choosing an appropriate framework--considering my skill-set. Thanks in advance, fellas.",1207182918

AFAIC, if you don't make it in time for this or anything else, tough.<p>(Don't mean to sound so harsh, but welcome to the reality of the business world.

I say this after seeing a bunch of angel forums / VC workshops in the bay area.  Many of the ""ideal"" presentations had no product, no engineers but a ""strong management team,"" a large market, and a path to bigness.  You are unlikely to get funded without a grand slam story.",1207181823

Here's what he wrote:<p><i>""Our college graduates are roughly equivalent in ability to other nationsâ€™ high school graduates, and a lot of our high school graduates could not compete on the world market for any jobs other than manual labor.""</i><p>You'll also note that he cites an article to support the premise.  That said, having taught a few senior-level courses at a top-tier university, I think he's right.  The quality of undergraduate education at most schools is abysmal, especially large public schools.<p>Top US universities are best known for their <i>research programs</i>, not their teaching.

I'm kinda old, so maybe I'm just too far down the Zuckerberg curve to understand.<p>So, I saw a ""trend"", I guess, called ""World Politics"" with a picture of Obama bein' cool (like all other pictures of Obama...that dude's definitely got cool down), clicked it, and found...nothing?  I mean there was a page there, but there was just a picture of a couple of foreign dudes (World Politics...makes sense I guess) and a random video.  And then I felt an overwhelming feeling of, ""I want those 30 seconds back"".<p>So, reading the comments here, I'm beginning to grasp the concept of the site, and I now realize why I was so disappointed by the content I saw: It was generated by an idiot user, the most common creature in the known universe.  So, the system needs to be better at solving the hard problem of helping idiot users create something useful.<p>Your site design is nice, if a bit busy.<p>The ""browse"" page is a much better overview than your front page, which I found intimidating and confusing.  Browse, while it could be mistaken for ""just another social news site"" is actually comprehensible to me, and makes your site seem more interesting...it also seems to allow the genuinely interesting stuff to rise to the top, so I don't wind up on the nonsensical ""World Politics"" page that has nothing interesting to look at or read.<p>I think maybe this is a case where simplifying your application would be a net positive.  Easier said than done, I know, as I'm sure every little feature on the site had someone campaigning for it at some point in the devel/beta cycle.  But new users show up and see an explosion of confusing concepts and no clear entry point to get involved.",1207181095
