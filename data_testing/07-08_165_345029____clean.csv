Unfortunately resume buzzword bingo is a fundamental of that type of low quality screening. \nYou can get high quality contacts through other methods. Open source contributions, &quot;published&quot; papers, public presentations, and mailing list comments all provide very good signal for recruiting candidates. Old fashioned networking through peers, user groups, and conventions can not be beat. Those types of contacts usually lead to an internal referral, which is one of the best indicators for hiring.<p>By &quot;show your abilities&quot; i was thinking of during the interview. When someone asks you how to implement a linked list (ugh) ask questions, use code comments, note edge cases and optimizations, heck write a quick test case to go with it.

A key point is demonstrating knowledge of a problem domain instead of asserting it.<p>WRT &quot;correct&quot; leveling its very hard to get right.

6422277,comment,6391701.0,6403611.0,1,0,waps,,,"Hmmm true. So let&#x27;s see what Bayes&#x27; formula says :<p>A = recovering drug addict\nB = suicide victim<p>Bayes theorem P(B|A) = P(A|B) P(A) / P(B)<p>First link google found with some numbers :\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1932152"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1932152</a><p>P(B) is much smaller than P(A), assuming most recovering drug addicts do not actually commit suicide. Let&#x27;s say 3/4 don&#x27;t (this is meant to be a lower bound, since increasing this number will mean drugs are responsible for more suicides, given the rest of the calculation). Therefore P(A) / P(B) ~= 4.<p>So this depends on what fraction of suicides drug addicts represent. If that fraction is above 25%, that means drugs lead to suicide. If that fraction is less, then they don&#x27;t.<p>According to the article that fraction is between 25% and 70% (in 25% of cases suicide victims were clearly addicts, in 75% of cases drug abuse was seen before the suicide).<p>While this is not too rigorous (esp. the sources part), this seems to indicate that &quot;scientifically&quot; you&#x27;d clearly find drugs cause suicide. If the fraction of suicides were to be ~ 45%, that would mean drugs increase suicide risk about 4-fold (and thus the number of suicides in a given group). That does not sound like an unreasonable number to me. It also means that free availability of drugs, increasing the number of people exposed will increase suicides by a factor between 1 and 4, depending on how big the problem currently is.<p>An effective banishment of drugs from our society would cut suicides by that number, between 25% and 70%, assumed to be about 45%.<p>The obvious criticism of this would be that P(A) and P(B) are nothing but a rational estimate, given that you ONLY know the things on the right side of the equation. In practice we know more. It&#x27;s still very likely to be a good approximation though.<p>So good point about reversal of causality, but following through on that point yields more evidence for it to be true, not less.",1379749441

I think desktop is moving towards sandboxed too, and will inevitably become more restrictive following Apple&#x27;s lead. I think that&#x27;s a good thing and we have the resources now to get that increased security without losing much performance.<p>Simple - I do think the simplicity of the web is is its greatest strength - it does limit what you can do with the web, but it also means it is not too hard to either produce content or create a browser (though nowadays the browser part <i>is</i> pretty challenging). CSS gradients are a good example in fact of the messy web process of experimentation, consensus, and eventual convergence - you will soon be able to use the prefixless style and not worry about several prefixed versions. Personally I&#x27;m not sure prefixes are a good idea anyway, but they do go away eventually.<p>Open - I meant as in anyone can contribute to the standard, and any vendor can write a browser, no one party controls it, as they do native platforms. I&#x27;m quite happy Java is blocked given who controls Java :) On the server of course, you can use whatever you want, whatever framework, language and paradigm you like, which is quite liberating when compared to say creating apps for iOS.<p>Extensible - well the standard actually allows for other languages, and JS being the only scripting language is more a quirk of history than anything else - there have been moves to allow byte code instead (Nacl), and I suspect that&#x27;s the way things are heading - to a sandboxed VM which will run any compiled language. When that happens then a huge range of languages will open up, just like server side.<p><i>That being said, I don&#x27;t see why non-locked-down native platforms are bad.</i><p>The biggest reason they&#x27;re bad from my point of view is that they don&#x27;t cater as the web does to hardware not invented yet (as the web does), obsolete hardware, or to other hardware platforms and are locked-in to a particular chip and instruction set, even if not locked down to an API. The other disadvantage is that you are locked in to whatever API (and typically language) the platform has chosen - everything must be written with that language, or with glue code interfacing to that language.<p>That&#x27;s the big difference with the web - it defines a limited reference platform (the browser) which can be made for any hardware, and anyone can target using any server side tech they want. There is a clear division between client and server, and both can change completely without invalidating the other. That&#x27;s a very powerful abstraction and one which I think gives it an advantage as a platform against any native platform which rivals it.",1379749235

I don&#x27;t have experience with kids, but I would prefer a system of &quot;circles&quot; and &quot;levels&quot;.<p>For each discipline, there would be defined different levels of ability. To attain a level, you would have to go through exam. If you would fail, you could repeat the level (even multiple times). Each level would be attainable in about half-year of directed study. So there would be no grades, only levels - you couldn&#x27;t get best grades, because there would always be some level above you which you would attempt to attain.<p>Now kids would be grouped into circles primarily based on ability at the discipline, not age. So you could be older in one group and younger in another, depending on how good you are. That way, the typical social hierarchy in classroom would be limited. I also think presence of the older kids could prevent lot of bullying, and kids could make more connections with other kids that are better or worse in different disciplines. Of course, there should be ingrained a culture of helping to learn (those with higher levels should help those with lower levels).<p>You could select yourself which levels in what disciplines you want to attain each semester, however there would probably be some basic total curriculum you have to go through. Also you couldn&#x27;t opt for less total work; if you fail the level, you would have to repeat it, so you would be motivated not to fail.",1379747794

Dirty two-stage thermonuclear: Fusion contributes between 1 and 50% of yield.  Most of the yield comes from fissioning of the U-238 tamper by fast neutrons.<p>4. Clean two-stage thermonuclear: Fusion contributes 90-99% of yield.  The U-238 tamper is replaced with beryllium or lead, which does not undergo fission when hit with fast neutrons.<p>5.
