Every news you read from a British source should be cross-checked with another source (just so you have another take on it).<p>Don't get me wrong, I have no animosity toward the UK or anything like this. I also find BBC's reporting to be of very high quality and I watch it daily. However there is total unfairness regarding the Europe thing at the BBC.<p>Basically I'd sum their coverage as ""See what's going on? We told you so!"".<p>That said, I disagree with you regarding the ""stay out of the Euro"". I now think that it is sad that the UK didn't get more involved in the Europe. The UK is probably the only country that could have weighed enough to get France and Germany to actually implement another management.<p>Europe is victim of the ""small team"" problem. It's a small team so it's ok if the two biggest guys manage it hand in hand because everybody's just ok with that and nobody can really challenge them. Problem arise with tougher times like we experience.<p>You guys should have really pushed us :) My opinion: we needed you to kick us and tell us it's not ok to just take the lead; it needs to be formalized AND <i>democratic</i>.",1321163911

But given that the hardware was built (at great expense!) specifically to run that OS, I think it's fair to consider their performance together.<p>Certainly the gap between ""the hardware the OS needs"" and ""what is readily available"" shrunk as time went on.  The slabs with more RAM were substantially better than the cubes had been.  I think calling NeXTstep with 16MB ""quite nice"" is still being generous though - my recollections of 16MB NeXTstep was ""swaps less"".  With 32MB it started to get pretty reasonable but, gosh, that was $1000+ of RAM back then.<p>I knew people who ran NeXTstep on Intel but they tended to turn into early linux adopters.  X11+fvwm (or, later, AfterStep) was more responsive on their hardware.<p>By the time NeXTSTEP 3.3 came out (and NeXT basically left the OS game, instead focusing on OpenStep and WebObjects) the performance gap was a lot smaller, at least if you could afford a really nice computer.  When it reemerged as a product 5 years later as OS/X 10.0 that gap had evaporated.  Suddenly it was living in its moment, 12 years after its debut.<p>And hell, now the OS that I used to curse for its unreasonable hardware demands comfortably runs on my cell phone.

Consequently, we take great offense if even the simplest of statements are misworded (regardless of intention). Consider the difference between, ""Give me the salt"", and ""Hey, would you mind passing me the salt? Thanks."" We constantly pollute our speech by adding phrases whose only purpose is to prevent offense. And anyone who doesn't is an asshole. An arrogant jerk.<p>You've heard the advice, common in books on communication or leadership, that the best way to persuade another is to avoid harming his ego. Allow that person to save face at whatever cost. Lie if you have to. Suggest that your idea is really <i>his</i> idea, and that it's brilliant.<p>Is this type of manipulation (and let's be honest -- this <i>is</i> manipulation) really so much better than blunt honesty? It's more effective, to be sure. If you don't already command the respect of a deity, you have to play this game. But for a Gates or a Jobs, is bluntness really such a travesty?
