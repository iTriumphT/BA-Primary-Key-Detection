With practically no drawbacks and only benefits, it goes against economics to not do it. It doesn&#x27;t matter if its a CD, game, website, a car, a high end CNC, or a coffee maker. Retaining effective ownership after sale is just so useful from a corporation point of view. Never again does a product need to escape into the control of an customer.<p>That this story might be explained with regulation is not much of an surprise. No US politician would dream of publicly stand for the view point of taking down private ownership and giving the control to corporations, even if regulations then can easier be enforced.
