But there's nothing stopping you from breaking up your program into small utilities that have a simple interface.  Those utilities don't need to be generic or widely applicable. But separating them from the main program can help.<p>Just to give an example, I once had trouble writing a function that transformed a particular tree data structure.  I ended up breaking it in two: the walking part, that took the transformation part as an argument.  And of course the transformation part.  Note that the walking part was fairly generic, and could have been use for other purposes (heck, one of its arguments where a function!).  But I didn't write it for that.  I wrote it to reduce the amount of brainpower I would need to finish my program, through dumb separation of concerns.",1343494693

4305866,comment,4304165.0,4304979.0,1,0,Darmani,,,"That's a good intuition, but I think the author avoided that for some important foundational reasons.<p>There are two main ways of developing probability theory.<p>The first way is to use measure theory. This means that probability is literally defined as an area or volume, and leads to the picture you describe. However, it forces you to think of probability as picking from a set of possiblities, and it also means you can arbitrarily carve up a shape or jam infinitely many of them together. You also need to be quite careful, as you may be taking the area of some rather weird shapes.<p>The second way is to assign ""plausibilities"" to various propositions, and then use them following a few common-sense rules. This assumes a lot less, but Richard Cox proved it gives the same result as the previous method when they both apply. However, you can now talk about the probability of rain without needing to be able to decompose it into statements about the trajectory of clouds. This also lets you talk about the probability the sun will rise tomorrow or the probability I am typing this from a hot tub without thinking about possible worlds or alternate histories.<p>The author is a huge proponent of the latter approach, and thus likely tried to avoid talking about shapes or regions.<p>In high school, you probably learned the classical definition of probability, where, if I say that something happens with probability A/B, it means that, if I do an event infinitely often, on average it will happen A out of B times. This turns out to be too fragile. I can make a die where the probability of rolling an odd number is 1/2 and the probability of rolling a number below 3 is 1/3, but the probability of rolling a 1 is undefined!",1343493879
