992357,comment,991834.0,992069.0,0,0,jsz0,,,I figure a SmartPhone that is sold subsidized at $199 with a two year contract works out to about 10-15% of your monthly bill but it depends on the actual cost the carrier pays for the phone and the monthly package costs. So it would translate into a modest savings <i>if</i> the carriers actually discounted the packages on non-subsidized phones. They do not. So you're paying that extra 10-15% either way. Doesn't seem fair to me.<p>The added competition of customers not being locked into contracts is defeated by competing standards. Many GSM phones won't work on T-Mobile's 3G network and most of the handsets engineered specifically for T-Mobile don't work on AT&T's 3G. An unlocked CDMA phone would fair better since you would have legitimate choice between Sprint & Verizon. What we really need is an unlocked GSM/CDMA hybrid and we might see some real competition.,1260675560

My own (admittedly controversial) opinion is that lisp is old, and it's ""syntax"" is broken because it's nonexistent.  Python has it's own problems, but it is less broken. :-)<p>The raw basic ""syntax"" in terms of the parens is a bear to read (and write), but you get used to it.  It may be different, but that isn't really the problem.  Anyone can figure out nested parentheses and escaping.  Just as someone else pointed out -- this isn't alien territory .. nested parens/brackets/whatever and literal escaping are common in complex/terse code in <i>any</i> of the popular languages.  Possibly Haskell is different, but I find it's terse syntax of juxtaposition more inscrutable than lisp, for the most part.<p>The problem is that in practical terms, the lisp syntax <i>is not</i> just nested parens and various forms of quoting and basic function invocation.  The syntax includes the positions of arguments to various standard macros and special forms. Are they are sublists or inline? what are the keywords? And most importantly, are they evaluated or not?  From an academic point of few, this technically could be considered semantics of a programming language, but I think that's false -- we don't consider human sentence structure semantics.  This is totally syntax.  And in lisp, it's highly irregular from form to form.  It's just something you have to ""know"" based on the form, and the lack of syntax other than parens and quotes certainly doesn't help you at all here.<p>Compared to something like python, it's unreadable and confusing.",1260674520
