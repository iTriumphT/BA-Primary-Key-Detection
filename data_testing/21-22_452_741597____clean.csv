The open-source world already has plenty of socially conventional advocates promoting their products. If the FSF became an ordinary open-source software promoter, it wouldn't have nearly as much influence as, say, the Ubuntu marketing team.<p>But there aren't many organizations trying to derive software principles from objective logic instead of subjective cost-benefit analysis, who insist that freedom and controlling your own computing is not just another feature but a vital issue. RMS may not convert many Windows users, but he does come up with valuable insights. If no one else is going to be a vocal, uncompromising advocate for software users, I can cringe through Windows 7 Sins and jokes about letting presidents drown.",1303595950
2477679,comment,2477586.0,2477586.0,93,0,emilsedgh,,,"A few points i would like to remind everyone who criticizes rms.<p>1) rms is a radical guy. You cannot change that. He fights for what he thinks is right. He is not the kind of person you can ask to censor himself.<p>If he thinks u.s goverment is to blame for 9/11, no matter how saying it in a lecture seems childish, he will say it.<p>If you invite rms for a lecture, he is coming with his radicalism. That is to be expected. You cannot invite rms and expect steve jobs.<p>2) rms is a practical guy. stop acting like he's a mad man who knows nothing. He started GNU, wrote emacs, glibc, gcc and probably others. He created the concept of free software and wrote a license as good as GPL to defend it.<p>He also managed to gather a community around this very crazy idea of free software.<p>3) rms doesnt want people only to use free software. he wants people to value their freedom, and as a result of that, use free software.<p>It doesnt really matter if whole world uses android instead of ios. The point is, these days, most people involved in open source community, do not even care about free software and the freedom it offers.<p>Most people are interested in technological advancements or affects of an open source project on market. None of them are concerns for rms.<p>And, what i said above is just what i interpreted from his actions and are not facts.",1303595918

Things go up and down, they do not stabilize for any length of time.<p>The above quote is famous because it was terribly wrong, and it came from a respected voice. In the USA, the recession had already begun, which later developed into the Great Depression.<p>For context:<p>""Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. I do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels, such as (bears) have predicted. I expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months.""\n- Irving Fisher, Ph.D. in economics, Oct. 17, 1929<p>He said this 12 days before Black Monday.<p><a href=""http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials_01/seymour062001.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials_01/seymour062001.html</a><p>I recall some economics blog, it was either Calculated Risk or Paul Krugman, pointed out several examples of ""a permanently high plateau"" being applied to the USA housing market circa 2005-2008.

2477666,comment,2477345.0,2477602.0,4,0,dotBen,,,"Sure, I'll comment on the feasibility of this: it's a ridiculous idea.<p>One of the features that allows AWS to scale is that it runs on a unified and consistant hardware platform.  Take a look at the recent Google Data Center video or the Facebook Open Server initiative - companies try where possible to run identical hardware for all of their needs as it removes inconsistances in behavior and performance between arbitrarily different pieces of equipment.<p>So the idea of giving Amazon your own hardware to host is terrible.<p>The other part of his idea sounds like mirroring servers so that if an EC2 instance goes down, some bare-metal hardware running elsewhere could kick in.  That's totally feasible, but no need to do it in the same DC under Amazon's control.  Just set up your own machines (bare-metal or virtual) and keep them in sync with your EC2 instance.  In the event of EC2 going down you can just change your DNS over to point your fall-back IP or do some clever off-site IP load-balancing tricks (assuming the load balancer hasn't gone down too)<p>In fact this would have been a good strategy for the ECG monitoring folks if they needed to keep service up even during a prolonged EC2 outage.",1303595778

No one says otherwise.<p>But Map Reduce does, IMO, do one thing that MPI doesn't: the easy things are easy.  Hard stuff is still hard, but easy things are easy.

It's the home of the University of Michigan.  It's not a small town.  It's got an activist base not dissimilar to San Francisco.  And it's got a reputation (perhaps skewed by my own local sense) of being a place with a lot of bright, interesting young minds and otherwise successful and wealthy folks.<p>Detroit, on the other hand, is generally written about as though it's a city in a war torn third-world country.<p>Before I ask my question, I really don't this comment to be taken rudely (and I'm having a tough time phrasing it in a way that doesn't sound like I'm pointing a finger: ""You're not really in THE D!!!"")

I do not live in Detroit, but grew up in the metro area and have a very personal relationship with the good and the bad parts of the city.  Most of us from the place I grew up, when asked, respond with ""I'm grew up in Detroit"".  It's a small talk ""out"".  It avoids the whole ""where exactly is that"" in the conversation (which, when you're from The Mitten State, requires pulling out your right hand to point at where you actually live).  The ""I grew up in Detroit"" has changed the last 5-10 years to include the important <i>a suburb (or even a distant suburb) of Detroit</i> because it's no longer an ""out"" to say I'm from Detroit.

This will either be correct (in which case both missing and dupe are even, or both are odd), high (the missing one was odd and the duped one was even), or low (the missing one was even and the duped one was odd).<p>If high or low, we've just pinned down the last binary digit of each of the numbers.<p>If even, the digit remains in an unknown state.<p>2) Slice off the last digit.<p>3) Repeat 1) and 2) for all 64 bits.<p>4) Now we have our missing number in the form 001001x1...xx01x (64 bits worth), where the x's represent digits where the missing number's digit matches the duped one.<p>5) We know the difference between the missing and duped numbers because of the triangular sum formula N(N+1)/2.  Use that to solve for the xs in the missing number.  That equation will <i>not</i> be possible to solve in general, but the statement of the problem here assures us that it will have a solution; further, I'm pretty sure that as long as the duped and missing numbers are not equal, that solution will be unique (EDIT: it's not, and this method doesn't work at all :P ).<p>Maybe I'm missing something, though?

The most popular Shinkansen route, Tokyo<->Osaka, is about the same distance between Chicago and St. Louis: a 6 hour conventional train ride, a 5 hour drive, or ... a 30 minute flight.  So high-speed rail is kind of a hard sell: a 5 hour drive is not that long, and a 30 minute flight is worth the cost if you really need to be there fast.  The middle ground, a 2 hour train ride, is not really that compelling, and a ticket would probably cost as much as flying.  (The first time I took the Shinkansen, I had a little sticker shock.  $200 to ride a train!?)<p>Rail does make sense for Tokyo to Osaka, though, because the airport in Tokyo is so far away from the city center.  It's at least an hour and a half between Tokyo Station and Narita, and then you need to be there in time to navigate the terminal and board 30 minutes before departure.  Then you have to do the same thing on the other end.  So flying is a net loss between Tokyo and Osaka, which is why the Shinkansen is so successful.  Lots of demand, and it's the quickest way to go.<p>But in the US, the places where high-speed rail will work already have high-speed rail.  The other popular city pairs are too far apart -- New York to LA is popular, but that's going to be an awfully long train ride.",1303593030
