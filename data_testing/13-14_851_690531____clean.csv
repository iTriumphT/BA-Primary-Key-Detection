I'm not sure that certain segments of the software world have done themselves any favors by giving businesses and consumers the idea that software should always be free.  No other industry works this way, where the core product is given away for free and the actual income must be garnered through donations/advertising/?.<p>Developing a product for fun is one thing, but taking the extra several months/years to polish it and make it saleable, along with setting up the necessary infrastructure to do so, is something that requires some possibility of profit.  Without this possibility, most developers won't bother, and we end up with a ton of half-completed software projects that may have been something good if seen through to the end.<p>I see this as especially a problem with developer tools/languages, which are experiencing serious fragmentation and ""language of the month"" symptoms on the free side of the market, while also experiencing significant consolidation among the big players on the for-profit side of the market.  A symptom of this dysfunction is that the biggest platform (for all intents and purposes, it is a ""platform"") in the world right now, the browser, only uses a single language - Javascript.  I can't think of any platform in the past 40 years that only allowed the use of a single language.<p>Just to clarify: trial software and any business model that allows potential customers to try out software before buying is a perfectly legitimate business model.  Giving away software for free, getting a bunch of users, and then dumping the project because you can't afford to support it anymore, is not.  Such a model is a recipe for chaos and an industry in constant turmoil.",1295616461

You have it exactly backwards.  The tedious and distasteful stuff is first in line for automation, not last.  The stuff that <i>cannot</i> be automated is <i>always</i> the most interesting stuff, because it is the bit that requires you to engage your brain.<p>Example: automation can give you really really bad software design, but for good software design nothing comes close to doing it 'by hand' (or rather 'by brain').",1295615990

It's just not a community of tinkerers that's on the cutting edge. I can't think of a single exciting .NET open source project. All of the good stuff that I know of in .NET is commercial: Stack Overflow, Unity, umm... anything else?
