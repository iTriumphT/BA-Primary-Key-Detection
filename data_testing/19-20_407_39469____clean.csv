I read somewhere recently that people are descendants of many more women than men (meaning women have children more often than men - few men are fathers).<p>Women not needing the money of their spouses - will they really just be attracted to a wider variety of men? Another thing I read recently is that women are becoming more likely to care for physical attractiveness now. Good for them, but I can't really see the benefit for men gained from that.<p>Also what tires me is the assumption that women where held down by barriers we erected. I think in ""former times"" it simply wasn't possible to survive alone, and the traditional roles where one successful approach to managing life. Women were supposed to do the household chores because men were working at their jobs earning the money.<p>What really freed women therefore was not the destruction of barriers.

Java is a great place to learn about unit testing, DI, and design patterns. The value of these is of course up for debate, but knowledge is power, and Java gives you a great chance to get this knowledge.

What's to stop me from making reservations at ten different restaurants for my blind date tonight, and deciding at the last minute which one will make the best impression on my date?  The system relies on honesty.  It only works because few people are willing to abuse it, and those who do so only do it in a small way.  This business would either be blackballed and frozen out by the restaurants, or the reservation system it depends on would be abandoned.<p>But let's say you could convince restaurant owners that selling reservations is a dandy idea.  Sure, restaurants have long known (the idea isn't new) that they could, for a very minimal cost, sell reservations to the highest bidder.  Sure, almost all have decided to go with a system that is perceived as free, fair, and egalitarian (with some discretion for doing favors for VIPs and accommodating glamorous people.)  Suppose you can convince them.  Why wouldn't they do it themselves?  Restaurants manage their image very carefully and would certainly prefer to be in complete control.  They could just do it in a notebook until (as the phenomenon caught on) their reservation software offered support for it.<p>The only plausible way I could see the business surviving is by charging lots of money (fewer customers limits your visibility) and kicking some of the money back to maitre d's as bribes.",1256930668

912587,story,,,10,22,tokenadult,Ask HN: Is there any excuse not to know Java?,,"I have complete buy-in to the idea that Lisp is an elegant computer language, and general buy-in to the idea that knowing a lot of languages from a lot of paradigms is good for perspective and for problem-solving. As Alan Perlis said, ""A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing."" Any programmer can gain new ways of thinking by learning a new language.<p>But asking more for students whom I advise than for myself, is it at all expedient for a young person entering the job market today to be unfamiliar with Java? Java has its own set of trade-offs, but doesn't it continue to be employed in many applications in many industries?",1256929978

CouchDB supports P2P style applications- that is you only have to replicate the data you actually want to share with remote instances. Your data remains your own and private to your machine.,1256929830

One could also use a definition like:\n""Continuous set of points such that each is distance d from exactly one other, and further from none.""  The modern definition is convenient because it's a special case of a convenient definition of ellipse, but there's nothing terribly fundamental about it.<p>And yes, every time you've done math with radians, that problem has haunted you.  That's because we decided to use radians instead of ""diameter-ans"", to keep with the above definition.",1256929393
