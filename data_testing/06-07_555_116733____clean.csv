MySQL launched in 1995, right around the time that the idea of generating hypertext dynamically was taking off, so a bunch of web stuff was looking for a lightweight, fast DB without necessarily a lot of features. Postgres had been around since the 1980s as a research project, and in 1994 was publicly released as an open-source project and added SQL support (rather than its own query language), but it was sort of off the internet's radar as a research project mostly known in academia.

If you had infinite time to spend on one patient, there's a possibility you could research the current literature, find something that correlates to something on a printout they brought you, and if you're lucky and it's the right kind of condition, have somewhat more information on which to make a good treatment decision. But that's doing original research, and pretty speculative research at that, and as a full-time doctor you can't also be doing full-time research developing new treatments. More to the point, the vast majority of medicine isn't really medical-TV-show-style complex sleuthing cases that need every clue possible. There are <i>way</i> bigger sources of error than genetic variation, like overworked doctors totally missing tell-tale symptoms, or patients not finishing courses of antibiotics, that are much lower-hanging fruit if you wanted to look for ways to improve health-care.<p>It hasn't gotten common enough to be a problem yet, but one of my friends in particular is <i>very</i> worried that the main effect will be to create an even bigger new class of people who've self-diagnosed incorrectly and refuse to be corrected or follow treatment suggestions from their doctor, like the current crop of people who will go doctor-to-doctor until someone gives them an antibiotic that they're convinced they need.",1280125308

I think a few major things contributed to this:<p>1) MySQL focused on performance first while PostgresSQL positioned themselves as ""feature-complete.""<p>Of course, that was years ago and in the meantime they became comparable in both aspects. MySQL+InnoDB is ACID compliant and Postgres matches the InnoDB performance.<p>Sure, Postgres might still have the upper hand in the variety of features but MySQL has MyISAM. If you don't need transactions you can get a significant performance boost over Postgres. Speed IS a feature and one could argue it's more important to many than all the nice extra things Postgres has.<p>2) MySQL was compatible with mSQL so they got a pretty good user base right from the start. mSQL later became obsolete.<p>3) Inertia. Even if Postgres would be net superior to MySQL (think feature complete but faster than MyISAM) it would still take a lot of time to catch up, if ever. There are tons of tools already developed for MySQL and a huge knowledge base around it. Just like C++, Windows, or any other big technology, there's a lot of inertia to it.",1280124569

Over the years a lot of packages have for various reasons statically linked in private copies of a library (sometimes on purpose, sometimes just because upstream did so), which causes the Debian security team no end of headaches, because they have to track down all of these and fix them if there's a security-relevant bug. Since Debian Stable tries not to push too many updates unless absolutely necessary, it also screws things up there, because instead of updating one package for one library's bug, they have to update all N packages that made private copies of the library, so sysadmins expecting rare, infrequent security fixes instead get presented with a big pile of packages that want to be updated.",1280124231
1547284,comment,1546911.0,1546911.0,0,0,jballanc,,,"First, let me say that I'm very much in favor of the direction that 23andMe is headed. Personalized genetic medicine <i>is</i> the future. Generic small molecule treatments (and by generic, I mean that they're given to patients based on the disease and not based on the patient+disease profile) have pretty much hit their limit of efficacy and biologics are a lot like supersonic airliners: they'd be great in theory if there weren't so many problems with them in practice.<p>I also sympathise with the way that the GAO, the FDA, and a number of other groups that have been weighing in on this issue have been lumping together 23andMe with some of the less reputable players in this burgeoning industry.<p>That said, I still don't agree with what 23andMe is doing. I've nearly completed a Ph.D. in computational biochemistry and have been helping my wife with her thesis in cell signaling, and the only thing I can tell you about the information contained in a genetic profile that 23andMe provides you is that you can't really tell much, if anything, from the profile that 23andMe provides you. Even supposedly straight-forward genetics like the presumably Mendelian pattern of inheritance in CFTR SNPs can get complicated fast. For example: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14966131"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14966131</a><p>Of course, the real problem with 23andMe isn't with 23andMe but with the FDA. The FDA's job, first and foremost, is to keep people safe. <i>IT IS NOT THE FDA's CONCERN TO SEE NEW TREATMENTS DEVELOPED!</i> The result of this is that the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry are caught in a bit of a catch-22. Everyone that I've spoken too (including past CSO's of large-name pharmaceutical companies) recognizes that including genetic profiling of patients in drug trials might reveal that different people benefit from some drugs more than others, and that this is linked to genetics. In fact, you can probably recognize this yourself: When you get a headache, what do you reach for? For me, Ibuprofen does the trick, but Acetaminophen (Paracetemol) does nothing. For my wife, it's the reverse. This is almost definitely linked to genetics.<p>The problem is that genetic profiling for drug trials is expensive and, get this, as of yet unproven to make a difference! Therefore, even if a pharmaceutical company went to the expense of including genetic profiling in their drug trial, the FDA would reject the results based on the fact that genetic profiling is unproven. So, nobody does genetic profiling. So you can't prove the usefulness of genetic profiling. etc.<p>Now, you might think that 23andMe has a chance of solving this issue, by allowing people to take control of their own genetic profiling, but I think they're actually doing more harm than good. Unless you are highly trained in genetics and keep up with recent literature, you're not going to know what to do with that profile. If you bring that profile to a doctor, they will pretty much have to disregard it without a second thought (see FDA argument above). Honestly, with the current state of medical research and pharmaceutical regulation, a 23andMe profile is worth the paper you printed it on. What's worse, the more doctors get pestered with people bringing in their own profiles, the less likely they are to pay heed to any of it, and the distraction that this causes the FDA, worrying about whether they should regulate 23andMe or not, prevents the root issue from being addressed.<p>I liken 23andMe to Quest Diagnostics. If you've visited a doctor recently, you're probably familiar with Quest. But when was the last time you went to Quest asking for a blood test without being prompted to do so by a physician? Honestly, you'd probably learn more on your own looking at the results of a cholesterol test or CBC than by perusing your own genetic profile. Until the U.S. (or, more likely these days, the E.U.) makes a major push for research into personalized genetic medicine, 23andMe will be little more than a novelty.",1280124179

One of their main pieces of advice is, before entering any negotiation, work out your BATNA - Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement.<p>A BATNA is not the lowest price you're willing to accept in a negotiation, but rather what you would do if the negotiation never occurred in the first place.  Bootstrap your product, try to gain traction, profit?  Raise angel/VC money, work towards an exit strategy?  Apply to YC?<p>Once you have that figured out, you can enter into a negotiation with a much better idea of the value of your product to you.  If there is overlap with that and what the other company is willing to offer for it, then you can make a win/win deal.<p>It also helps to have some idea of the value of your product to the other company, as you do.<p>Good luck, and congrats.",1280124008
