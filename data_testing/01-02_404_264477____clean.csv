I had to tutor operating systems to classes a year after me that had learn mostly java. There was a definite loss of understanding of what was going on under the hood. Blank stares on questions on calling conventions and where variables are stored, let alone virtual memory.\nI still wonder how those students can write efficient higher level code if they don't at least have a general understand what happens in lower levels.\nA good example of this is choosing a web framework in python. In a previous job I had co-workers that wanted to combine an async framework with a synchronous DB API, in a single thread, and expected high performance.",1312768671

2858407,comment,2856702.0,2857051.0,2,0,bubbleRefuge,,,"<i>Issuing currency is identically equal to inflation</i>  No.  There is demand pull inflation and cost push inflation.  If you remember from econ, inflation or price level is the intersection of supply and demand curves.   Since demand and supply are not constant, it is possible to issue greater amounts of currency in the face of greater amounts of supply and still see prices decline if the increase in supply outweighs the increase in demand from issuing more currency. What you are referring to is a gold standard or fixed exchange regime concept(this is what Austrians advocate).  In a gold standard, money is a receipt for a piece of gold sitting in a vault.  So issuing more money without increasing the supply of gold dilutes the value of money in terms of gold. In fact, this is where the term printing money comes from in the first place. This is not applicable in a fiat currency regime. In a fiat money regime, you can give everyone a million dollars tomorrow and if they don't spend it, there is no inflation.  No such thing as printing money in a fiat money regime.  All money is created and destroyed in the same way. There is no magical level where money goes from not being printed to being printed in fiat.<p><i>continually increasing deficit and debt is unsustainable.</i>  Yes but you have to have a model to tell you when to stop increasing deficits and arbitrary numbers like 10 Trillion or 4 Trillion don't mean dick.\nWith modern money, the size of the deficit is equal to the savings of the private sector.   Paying off the deficit decreases savings to the private sector which either leads to a recession or credit bubble ( to make up for the lost money.)  Deficits need to be targeted based upon the level of inflation and unemployment in the economy that policy makers wish to achieve. Obama cannot on the one hand call for ""fixing the deficit problem"" while on the other hand calling for more jobs. The two are pretty much antithetical.",1312767776

For another, Mac users are notoriously finicky. Personally, if you came up with an alternative that was great in almost every way, but was as graphically ugly as Eclipse, then I wouldn't switch. I'm kind of sad that years of Mac use has made me care about this kind of thing, but there you go.<p>Finally: Codewarrior. When Apple made the switch to x86, the Codewarrior guys decided that was one sea change too many, and gave up the fight.

Everyone can tweak it for the better or worse, and lately its mostly been for the worse.<p>However, if you don't want to root or get a nexus, I've found that simply installing one of the many launchers available for free mostly does the trick of cleaning up your phone (touchwiz, blur etc get removed and you can hide apps completely if you like). Also, this seems worst in the US, where the carrier situation is -forgive me- completely fucked up. I haven't had issues anywhere similar with bloatware here in europe.<p>I can only hope, but if capitalism works and people don't like scins and crapware on their phone, the cunts in charge right now will eventually realize it's smarter to leave Android as it is because more people will buy it.

They did a Living Social deal that for $40 let you come in six times (no more than once in a given month) for two entrees and a bottle of wine or a drink of your choice.\n\n    They got 1200 takers.\n\n    Like the auto repair deal, this one is a loser, depending on the customers buying other things to turn it around. Unfortunately for the cafe, the customers with the deal did not buy other things. They would not buy appetizers or desserts. They would just come in once a month for their six months, get their two entrees and a drink, and that's it. The owner says she lost $100k.\n</code></pre>\nThis blows my mind. The cafe owner should know exactly how much she is spending for each deal that is purchased. It's a marketing expense; each deal also has some estimated upside (repeat buyer, up-sell on the original visit, etc). By not placing a limit on the number of deals sold, the owner gave herself an unlimited risk.

Also, their blog site layout is quite flawed. The text hits the left edge of the page at 1000px width. First, text should never hit the left side of the page. There should absolutely always be a margin of no less than 8px, but nearly always should be at least 0.25"". Second, 1024px is more than half of a 1920px width screen and the site only looks proper at about 1280px width. This is too wide.<p>We (people using computers) have been forced into wide screen aspect ratio displays because of the need to show movies. Fine, that is the way it is. But this means that common use is to have two pages or tasks side by side. Full screen for tasks of reading produces lines that are much too wide to scan properly. Web pages should not require more than 960px for basic reading. The 960px includes the window scroll bars and frame if present, so the actual page text should be slightly smaller.<p>Do not design windows that expect 1024px or 1280px width, and do not design windows where the text crashes into the page edge when resized. Both these are very amateur hour mistakes. Therefore, it is inconceivable that the people at this firm are ""design legends"".",1312765295
