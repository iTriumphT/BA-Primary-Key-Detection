There are plenty of people who buy for underlying asset value and dividends.<p>See, for instance -<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Investor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Investor</a><p>Warren Buffet has said that The Intelligent Investor is the best book on investing ever written.<p>A fundamental tenet of value investing is that you're buying a small part of a business, not something separate from the business. Keynes is talking about buying stocks to speculative on short term price movements, which is risky and probably a bad strategy for the vast majority of people. But buying a share of a business that's fundamentally solid and priced attractively is rational, even if the business isn't currently popular.",1307854631

The author dismisses user friendliness with the implication that the only reason Linux is difficult to learn is because it is different.<p>The analogy given is vi versus a standard Windows word processor. I am not disputing that vi is a much more powerful program, but I am saying that it is much harder to learn than Microsoft Word. Using Word, without knowing the keyboard shortcuts, you can use the toolbars to do what you want and in doing so you learn the shortcuts, most of which are printed next to the menu items.<p>Using vi, without knowing any keyboard shortcuts, you can do exactly nothing.  Arguably vi is much better off without toolbars because they take up a lot of screen real estate and would be difficult to implement from a terminal window, but that does not mean there is no such thing as user friendliness.\nAnother problem is the problem of hardware support[1], which the author does not address at all.<p>Having said that, I will agree with his point that since it doesn't really matter much to (with notable exceptions) most developers what features people not already using Linux would like to see, development is centred around people already using Linux and on more gentle slopes of the learning curve.<p>1. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2643671"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2643671</a>",1307853606

L2, L3 and RAM are generally 'unified' or can contain either 'instructions' or 'data'.<p>This thesis proposes that separating memory to 'instructions', 'stack', and 'heap' results in a performance increase for functional languages.<p>Additionally this is targeted at software that makes a large number of function calls such that the time expense of function calls with current architectures is higher than the actually computational time expense of the code.<p>Personal opinion: Maybe this is faster at the inner most levels of memory if the code makes lots of function calls.  At the outer most levels of memory many things rely on the ability of 'memory' to be treated as either 'data' or 'instructions'.  JIT compilation for instance.  This would imply that to run general code there needs to be a separation process similar to what occurs between the L2 and L1 caches in current processors.

State and local leaders rolled out the red carpet for Amazon -- a free building site, property tax cuts, employment tax credits, and the repeal of a county law prohibiting Sunday morning sales.  But Amazon also wanted a five year exemption on collecting South Carolina sales tax.  After all, they would have a physical presence in the state, and there's absolutely no ambiguity about whether or not they'd have to collect sales tax at that point.<p>When the state legislature voted ""no"" on the sales tax exemption, Amazon immediately stopped construction on the warehouse and took down all of the job listings for that location.  There was a huge uproar, with supporters of the exemption accusing legislators of siding with ""special interests.""  (Where ""special interests"" apparently means ""every other business with a physical presence in South Carolina that doesn't get a sales tax exemption."")<p>Amazon won this game of chicken, however.  Faced with massive voter backlash, the state legislature flinched and voted 90-14 for a new deal that would exempt Amazon from collecting South Carolina sales tax until January 2016.

The Iron* projects were disappointing to see get dropped, but they never really were first-class citizens to begin with.<p>In fact, if anything, over the past few years I'd say the general sentiment has been that .Net has now eclipsed the JVM as the ""best"" platform available. Obviously not being able to deploy to other OSes (ignoring mono, of course) was a problem, but not a big one for a lot of folks. C# is a language a lot of people really enjoy using, and F# has excited a lot of people and since it's ""official"" gets accepted in stodgy corporate environments quicker than some of the alternatives (Scala comes to mind).<p>That said, yes, in the last month or two I have been surprised (but not disappointed) to see that MS seems to be reinvesting in C++. I'm a little confused by this Win8 stuff, though. I think MS focus on Silverlight over the past year or two was misplaced, when they should have been focusing on WPF first, and now I'm not really sure what the status of WPF is with ""Jupiter"".",1307852468

So, we decided to eat our own dog food, and use one of the startups we were working with in our incubator:  <a href=""http://VidCaster.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://VidCaster.com</a>.<p>Within a couple of hours of receiving the DVD from Naval's Hack your Funding process video, it was up and streaming on their service.  They also grabbed all the other video content we had on vimeo and transferred it over without any problems.  The following week, they streamed 1TB of video on our videos alone.  Not bad for a company that had only raised seed funding before that.<p>They are simply outstanding, and I'm not just saying that because they are in our incubator.  Their service really does rock.  Clean interface, amazingly responsive founders that have been running their own video businesses for years, and built VidCaster to scratch their own itch.<p>BTW you can look at all the pitch videos for our startups on <a href=""http://hackersandfounders.tv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackersandfounders.tv</a> for our upcoming ""Not-a-Demo-Day"" this Thursday night.
