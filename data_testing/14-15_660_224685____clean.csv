I left the PR industry after several years to pursue a career in development and know a bit. I'm not a superstar or the world's greatest BSer but I know a thing or two.<p>The thing about these general press relations articles written by a journalist or media outlet is that it's tailored to them.

I see it happen all the time, and not just in PHP.  Perl, Python, Ruby.<p>The problem is that to change the config options, you are essentially changing what amounts to the application, and if you break your config, you break your application.<p>The standard way of storing config options in PHP is with .ini files.  At least, in my circle.  Sure for quick scripts, we throw it in the actual code, but whenever we have to manage more than a few config options, it get's moved out.<p>I realize I'm expanding on what you said a bit. =)  I just want to make it clear that this isn't a PHP problem.

They justify this mostly based on promotion costs, but this is not even close to their profit margins.<p>Books are expensive because there is little competition, particularly with k-12 schools, largely based on political lobbying.<p>Of course, we aren't likely to dissolve lobbyists anytime soon; but the idea of socially conscious startups is to dream big.",1300546019

Often the children who attend schools who are the most at risk do not have access to computers/internet at home and community centers are often hard to reach both due to their distance and the danger in their traveling there.<p>I, a CS masters student, and my wife, a PhD EE, who attend University of Texas at Austin run an after school program for middle school kids to teach robotics and programming using lego mindstorms.<p>The school is one of the poorest in the city, but also has an integrated math/science magnet program within it. Our students are a mix of both the local children and the magnet kids who are bussed in.<p>At the beginning of class we place logic problems on the board and we were surprised to find that often the kids not in the magnet program solved them correctly often on par with those who were supposed to be the best and brightest in the city.<p>However when it came to programming and using the computers, the non-magnet students lagged behind the others at a pace of almost half the speed. Though they both were able to mechanically develop and debug their robot equally well.<p>I meet with the parents throughout the program and the correlation I noticed most prominently with those that suffered with programming was if the kid had easy access to a computer outside of school.",1300545114

The words to find are the same, but the arrangement of letters is different for each student.<p>It is trivial to write a program to generate word search puzzles, so I decided to make the problem more interesting by adding a difficulty parameter.

Data reliability and self-correction becomes an essential part of storage.<p>I've played a bit with ZFS myself and really enjoyed it. It's like the sum of everything we learned about filesystems and storage and previously used to shoehorn into various historical filesystems, only this time it's a clean and simple implementation.",1300543476

The systems used for this type of thing (tracking pushes, tests, start/end times etc) always seem to be highly custom-built. I imagine it'd be a lot easier to build this as you build you site from the ground up, rather than retrofitting it in afterwards.",1300543417

Also it's interesting to speculate about charge-spin separation in electrons (spinons, holons).<p>I have a pet (completely unworked) hypothesis that spin somehow exists across dimensions we experience and other dimensions - that the property could be a coupling with a ""spining"" (or spin) particle in a dimension outside Minkowski spacetime.",1300543315
