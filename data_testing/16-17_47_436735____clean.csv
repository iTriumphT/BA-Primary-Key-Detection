I think this is currently provided by 'portals' like fxall and currenex (bloomberg now too I think) where majors competitively bid on quotes when they want to and the buyer buys that which best suits them.<p>There's a couple of problem with deliberate chaining of interbank trades in that if the market moves far you might not get your countertrade (the quote will be rejected on the trade attempt - it's more common for quotes to be non-guaranteed than for them to be guaranteed, presumably because it's easier to build and avoids the situation where hedge funds start gaming you); and - irrespective of that - prices tend to get naturally stale fairly quickly (every few seconds but it's usually inconsistent) which means that latency is a factor.",1216745656

Most of the software I've encountered that displayed performance problems did so because of endemic architectural flaws and bad code. Pointless complexity usually leads to slow software.<p>In most well-written applications, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a version on C++ or a version in Java, because the software is rarely the bottleneck. Obvious exceptions are applications like games and 3D animation systems, where there's a lot of computation going on all the time.<p>A well-written word processor in Ruby might well feel MORE responsive than a poorly written one in C++, for example.",1216745639

We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.

I also use jQuery to set rollovers on elements where IE6 doesn't support the CSS hover property.<p>Finally, if I need to set some style specifically for IE6 only, I use the underscore technique described here:\n<a href=""http://web2pointo.wordpress.com/2008/03/02/css-hack-for-ie6-and-ie7/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web2pointo.wordpress.com/2008/03/02/css-hack-for-ie6-...</a><p>As long as I stick to these things, most IE6 issues don't affect me.

253374,comment,252857.0,253324.0,0,0,pdubroy,,,"It's an oversimplification to say the the four corners of the screen are the fastest targets to point at. According to Fitts' Law, the time to point to a target is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. In some cases that may be the corners of the screen (because they effectively have an infinite target size). But if the corners are very far away (as can be the case on large screens), then other nearby targets can be faster to acquire.<p>So, on a small screen, the Mac approach might be faster. On a large screen where the window size is a smaller fraction of the display size, the Windows approach might be faster.<p>But Fitts' law doesn't tell the whole story -- there's more to consider than just the raw target acquisition speed. What about the time you spend figuring out where the target is? That's probably lower with a single menu bar, because it's always in the same place no matter where the window is. But if the application has lots of controls in the toolbar, you might find that people instinctively start moving towards the toolbar first, before realizing that the command they need is actually in the menu bar. On Windows, it's a slight correction to start heading for the menu bar; on OS X, it might be a completely new movement.<p>A better example of how the multiple menu bar approach might be better: on a large monitor, when I have several non-overlapping windows, I sometimes head to the menu bar, only to realize that the wrong application is active. So I have to move the mouse again, select the correct window, then go back to the menu bar to make my selection. With multiple menu bars, this problem doesn't occur.",1216743396
