Keep in mind this before digital switching, which should make it even cheeper now.<p>Enabling every cell user or land line user in the U.S. to have unlimited calling for a low fixed price is achievable.  What makes it not happen is lack of regional competition (sure, there may be several cell providers in your area, but only one has great coverage) and this happens due to lack of teeth in bills from Congress.  We're still waiting for cell providers to let us use unlocked phones like most of the rest of the world.<p>I think the telco's days are numbered.  Consumers have known for a long time they are getting ripped off.  This lengthy recession (call it what you want) may cause pressure on Congress to provide some relief.  We may very well finally be able to buy an unlocked phone for less than $200 and use it on the most competitive carrier with no long term contract.  When that happens, you will get your unlimited calls for $20/month and only the poorest of the poor will use such an advertising supported service.",1247273592

I also don't necessarily think you should care that some browser sets a bad value - I guess the biggest issue is that since browsers are the most common HTTP clients, other HTTP implementations must conform to what browsers actually do, rather than the HTTP standard.<p>This points to one of the ""problems"" with HTTP -- it's very easy to hack together your own solution to a problem instead of following the standard.  This generally isn't a huge issue in any particular case, but it does increase the overall cognitive load of developers who deal with many APIs, make it harder to effectively utilize proxies and caching, and increase the amount of work that must be done by servers to accommodate the many clients out there, among other things.<p>For example, rather than the desired MIME type of the response being specified by the URL itself, or by a query parameter, or by a post body parameter, or by the Accept header, it should just be in one place: the Accept header.",1247272330

Say, Whitney Houston's version of _I Will Always Love You_.  In all other countries, they do.  U.S. radio still has to pay a ""mechanical"" fee to the songwriter - in this case, Dolly Parton, who originally wrote the song.  (ASCAP or BMI probably handles this on Dolly's behalf, as they do for the vast majority of songwriters.)<p>The fact that U.S. radio doesn't have to pay performance fees is an accident of history.  There is a bill in Congress that <i>would</i> make terrestrial radio pay performance fees.  (Satellite radio has to pay, so it's not really a ""we hate the internet"" thing.)
