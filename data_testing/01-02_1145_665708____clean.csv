I would like to add to this list the history of things BREAKING even with minor version updates (although to be fair a lot of this has been due to radical changes in the object model over the past few years).<p>I also think there's a fundamental problem with this question. I think one must make the comparison between web development frameworks, rather than saying PHP/Ruby/Python - you need to say Symfony (or PHP framework X - I just happen to like Symfony), Rails or Django (or Spring or Grails or whatever).<p>In that case: the comparison is simple and personal. Go to the Symfony tutorial, go do the Django tutorial, go do the Rails tutorial. See which one clicks the best.<p>I personally find PHP enjoyable to use because I've used it for a while and I'm used to it's idiosynchracies. I've used it for web development but I've also used it for command line daemon processes that have run, without fail, for the past 3 years.<p>I've never had cause to benchmark those processes in terms of performance with any other language because I've never run into performance problems, but your mileage may vary.<p>In short: I think PHP gets a lot of bad press - but PHP also gets a lot of things done.",1287798798

I am currently typing on a fairly old Packard Bell keyboard that has individual plastic switches.

I have an iPod Touch that I often use to surf the web... usually Hacker News in Opera Mini in fact. I can type fairly fast on the device as well... I have timed myself at 80wpm vs 120wpm on my normal keyboard. From time to time I have even used it to type serious things, such as a few page long history paper. It is never pleasent though. It feels like an absolute chore of utter concentration to type fast on the touchscreen keyboard. It's convinient enough to type a few short sentences here and there, but whenever I go type anything lengthy I cringe at the fact that I have to type there. I cannot imagine having something like the iPhone as my primary phone because of how much texting that I do (I chose my non-smartphone simply for having the best possible keyboard).

I have made many attempts over time to create my own (experimental) programming languages, mostly interpreters.<p>The problem is, my knowledge of this area of computer science is fragmented, to say the least. I picked up things here and there, but I never learned how to properly implement a compiler, interpreter, virtual machine, or even a parser.<p>So, I have decided to pick a book and work my way through it. I just don't know which book. They all seem equally intimidating. A few candidates that I am considering are:<p>- The Dragon Book (new version, 2006); seems awfully big though, making me wonder whether I should pick a book that is a bit less comprehensive first, then come back to this one later;<p>- The Dragon Book (old version, 1986)<p>- Engineering a Compiler, by Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon<p>- Parsing Techniques - A Practical Guide, by Dick Grune; focuses on parsing though rather than the whole package<p>So my question is, which of these books, or any others, do people recommend?

1822194,comment,1822092.0,1822092.0,0,0,neilk,,,"The standard gripes about PHP:<p>- PHP's syntax is very random. There are over 5000 builtins and no consistency among them.<p>- PHP lacks (or lacked until relatively recently) many programming niceties such as objects, types, closures, lambdas, and namespaces. To do anything interesting, PHP developers rely on globals or dubious innovations such as using a string as a function name.<p>- PHP relies on a web-serving model where the program invocation is done in milliseconds. Even if you can (with difficulty) use PHP libraries in command line programs, it's very inefficient for anything like a long-running daemon process.<p>- Although it is almost always built into a web server, PHP doesn't make it easy for you to do anything useful with web requests -- such as custom authentication in a separate phase from content generation.<p>- Since it's a web templating language at heart, PHP practically begs you to do the wrong thing and mix presentation and data. To solve this, many shops use a templating language on top of PHP, which does feel kind of silly.<p>- Due to its ubiquity, PHP is the choice of script kiddies who can't program. The comments on the PHP.net documentation site are mind-numbingly naive sometimes. So even experienced programmers feel dirty using PHP.<p>That said:<p>- Among comparable languages, and for typical web serving tasks, PHP is fast. Really fast.<p>- It's probably already installed on your platform of choice.<p>- Within the web-serving paradigm, it has almost everything you would ever want.<p>- Its model of programming is really brain-dead, but it also can keep you out of trouble since you're forced to do everything in a REST-compatible manner.<p>- It's also the choice of websites like Yahoo, Flickr, Facebook, and Wikipedia, so you know it is battle-tested.",1287796759

In fact I would argue it's faster to just collect your inputs and outputs (invoices and bills) and get them to your accountant once per month or quarterly, of half year, or yearly (depends how you told tax office how you will do it). Accountant does the rest for you. On the other hand, you could do it all by yourself and have an accountant check your papers and sign them (some people do it like that). Also, no capital gains tax here. :) But this country could do take some pro-active measures for startups.
