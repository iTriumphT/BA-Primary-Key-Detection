62858,comment,62617.0,62823.0,0,0,pius,,,"Right.  How can you refactor code that has no tests?  Basically, you've got no clue if your new refactored code works because all the precious time you've spent using the old code went towards ephemeral tests that weren't written down.  That makes refactoring a <i>lot</i> more risky than it needs to be.",1191459583

Instead, I got nervous and let them dictate the course of the interview and we didn't talk about the design and big picture of our product. It also really didn't help that we argued against Paul Graham's simplified, buildable in 3 months version of our product. I wonder if we would have got in if we would have said ""yes, that's a great idea."" Now I know that one of the things they test for is flexibility, so if they suggest changes to your product during the interview, don't argue with them.",1191459537
62855,comment,62800.0,62800.0,0,0,codeslinger,,,"I think both Werner Vogels and the paper itself were pretty clear that this was <i>NOT</i> the basis for S3. This line from section 1 is pretty telling even had they not spoken up on this:<p>""To meet the reliability and scaling needs, Amazon has developed a number of storage technologies, of which the Amazon Simple Storage Service (also available outside of Amazon and known as Amazon S3), is probably the best known. This paper presents the design and implementation of Dynamo, another highly available and scalable distributed data store built for Amazon's platform.""<p>More supporting evidence from section 2.1:<p>""Dynamo targets applications that need to store objects that are (usually less than 1 MB).""<p>S3 allows individual objects up to 5GB in size. This in and of itself does not rule out Dynamo being the underlying store for S3 but does certainly lend weight to what Werner and the paper's authors have claimed regarding S3's origin.\n",1191459480

62851,comment,62750.0,62844.0,0,0,jkush,,,I think this is a big deal for two reasons: it signals that Microsoft is starting to open up a little and the other reason is that getting code definition information through an IDE like Visual Studio is vastly superior to disassembling a .NET framework dll and inspecting the code.<p>,1191459088

62849,story,,,7,6,myoung8,An Observation about News.YC,,"In too many threads on news.yc someone points out a pattern only to have someone else refute it based on perosnal experiences. <p>I just want to point out that this is flawed logic!<p>It's not quite as simple as ""don't make generalizations"" (although many would do well to remember that). Danah boyd really crystallized this in one of her blog posts by pointing out that \npatterns are just that, patterns. There will always be exceptions (and maybe you are one of them), but exceptions and patterns are not mutually exclusive. Duh, right?<p>If it's so obvious, why do so many people craft their arguments this way? Just check out the comments in the post about how to find a co-founder for non-techies.<p>Maybe they just want to foster discussion, but it seems to me that we would get a lot more out of the forum if people qualified/quantified their comments.",1191458966
