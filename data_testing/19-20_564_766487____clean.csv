948985,comment,948963.0,948963.0,0,0,dkokelley,,,"To start, my Bank 2.0 would do a lot to change the way credit/debit cards are authorized. clawrencewenham had some great ideas about this here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=948965"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=948965</a><p>Basically the owner of the card would have final control over charges on it. The bank could automatically call or text you and ask for a code before authorizing a transaction, and the cardholder would have white and blacklists with custom rules about when/how much a particular merchant could charge.<p>In my bank, I would probably stay away from mortgages and credit cards (I could offer them through a 3rd part supplier, but I wouldn't carry any of the balances). This is to make reserves more manageable. Today's banks have massive departments dedicated to managing reserves and working with overnight and discount loans. By eliminating/outsourcing these functions, I think more could be dedicated to serving the customer. Most of the money for the bank would be made through an agreement with someone like Visa or Mastercard, so that whenever someone charges their card, part of the fee that merchants pay goes back to my bank as the card issuer.",1258574370

If there is a bank that can innovate and do it correctly, then it can work well. Commerce is a great example of one that did achieve it. Their efficiency ratio was higher than most peers but that’s because they kept their bank open 7 days a week and they made it so you really wanted to visit their branches. They used nice colors, had super friendly tellers (they weren’t stuck behind bullet proof windows or a mini gate), and they didn’t make branches look like a post office or a jail cell.<p>Their whole idea was putting more money towards non-interest expense but they were able to charge less for deposits since they were more convenient. It definitely worked. If you could invest in safe assets you could earn a wider NIM than peers.<p>HOWEVER:<p>You can be the most innovative banker in the world but if you make bad loans you’ll go down.",1258574149

Instead, it might be doomed.<p>Android allows for unfettered development, as does Symbian.  WebOS is headed that way too, according to their developer relations team.  On every other smartphone platform, you are (or will be) able to just develop an app and deploy it onto people's phones, without running the gauntlet of an approval process.<p>Judging from the current state of the App Store, the review process doesn't materially improve the quality of applications.  However, it does slow down and frustrate developers.  If open platforms like Android gain enough market share, I think a lot of devs are going to jump ship just so they don't have to deal with the headaches of review any more.<p>The folks running Apple aren't dumb.  They're sticking by their guns because the iPhone ecosystem is working marvellously right now.  However, if they start to see a large migration of developers, they'll probably do whatever it takes to bring them back.  And that might mean killing 'review'.",1258572279

If online daters were so good at that they probably wouldn't be trying to get a date online! There needs to exist mechanisms that help people to express themselves. Also, I could just be crazy, but it seems like there's some inherent dishonesty in presenting yourself via online dating. Are you lonely? Horny? Bored?

If you are interested in digital media (photos, videos, audio), social networking, community and mobile, you've come to the right place. Your colleagues would describe you as the ultimate team player who is passionate, aggressively realistic, and unafraid to reach for greatness. You know a well-designed product when you see one (or design one), and you're not willing to compromise until you find that perfect balance for your customer. You know startups because you've been involved in one or many, and you're ready to help create and nurture an amazing company culture. You do this because you love it--and you wake up every day thinking how lucky you are to be living your dream. You are also careful to make sure that your loved ones remember what you look like.

So with <i>N</i> cores, you can simulate <i>kN</i> neurons for some constant <i>k</i> (and I think that <i>k=1</i>).<p>This implies that the limit is the number of CPU cores you throw at the problem.
